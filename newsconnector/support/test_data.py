          "fulltext": "Pretoria - Paralympian Oscar Pistorius has received support from his family and friends during his murder trial because he is a kind and generous person, a friend from Iceland said.\n\n\n\nEbba Gudny Gudmundstottir and her mother flew from Iceland to Pretoria to support the athlete and his family as he faces murder charges after he shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in February last year.\n\n\n\n\"He is a very kind person, he is a good human being and you always feel safe and comfortable when you are around him,\" an emotional Gudmundstottir told Sapa.\n\n\n\n\"He takes care of his friends and he is there for them. He is very generous with his time and with his love and empathy.\n\n\n\n\"Oscar is just very special. That's why it is very difficult to understand what is going on here now.\"\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir sat in the back row of the public gallery in the North Gauteng High Court from 3-13 March.\n\n\n\n‘Just like Pistorius'\n\n\n\nShe cried in court on Monday, when pathologist Professor Gert Saayman described Steenkamp's wounds. Pistorius himself was emotional and was retching in the dock as Saayman spoke.\n\n\n\nSaayman said Steenkamp died as a result of multiple gun shots.\n\n\n\nPistorius is on trial for the murder of Steenkamp who was shot through a locked bathroom door of his Pretoria home on 14 February last year. He said he had mistaken her for an intruder.\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir said it was important to show physical support for the 27-year-old athlete who had been her friend for almost nine years.\n\n\n\n\"He was always there for us when we needed comfort. It is no tragedy to have a child who has no legs but there are difficult moments,\" she said emotionally.\n\n\n\n\"He was always there for us, so that's why we want to be here now when he needs friends. We wanted to give him physical support because that's what he gave to us.\"\n\n\n\nHer eight-year-old son Halli was \"just like Pistorius\" and he was born with missing fibulae bones, she said. Both his legs were amputated when he was 11 months old.\n\n\n\nBorn without fibulae, Pistorius had both his lower legs amputated before he was a year old.\n\n\n\nHe was the poster-boy of ambition and overcame adversity, becoming the first amputee to compete on the track in the able-bodied Olympics in 2012.\n\n\n\nHeartfelt gratitude\n\n\n\nAn emotional Gudmundstottir remembered how she befriended Pistorius.\n\n\n\nDoctors told Gudmundstottir when she was 20 weeks pregnant with her son that he would be born with no legs.\n\n\n\nShe remembered how worried, scared and confused she was because there was no record of a child being born like that in Iceland.\n\n\n\nShe said then they googled \"double-amputee\" and found a photograph of Pistorius running in the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens.\n\n\n\n\"I can't explain how happy I was [when I found the photograph] because I did not know what it meant when they told me my son did not have legs,\" Gudmundstottir recalled.\n\n\n\n\"I just really did not understand it. I did not know anybody with no legs so seeing this was like a miracle to me.\"\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir said her mother, who was also in court to support Pistorius, contacted a journalist who interviewed the athlete and asked him to convey the family's heartfelt gratitude for having been there \"without knowing it\".\n\n\n\nHer face lit up as she remembered the reply from Pistorius.\n\n\n\n\"He wrote my mom back and said 'hi I'm Oscar Pistorius, were you looking for me' with a smiley face,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"Then he said if there is anything I can help you with, just let me know.\"\n\n\n\nPatriotic\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir said they started corresponding and a year later he went to Iceland because of his blades and asked to meet the family.\n\n\n\nThe Gudmundstottir's invited him to their home and said as a family they had peace of mind after seeing Pistorius and seeing what he had accomplished.\n\n\n\n\"Oscar was extremely polite, and kind. He told jokes, he was just very kind to both my children. It was very obvious what kind of a person he is,\" she said.\n\n\n\nPistorius and the Gudmundstottirs became close and the family went to Manchester, in London, to see him run.\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir remembered one athletics meet when Pistorius won a gold medal and they were on a hill nearby.\n\n\n\n\"Oscar came running to us and he put his gold medal around my son's neck and he said to him 'this is for you champion' and my son was just beaming with joy,\" she recalled with tears in her yes.\n\n\n\nPistorius also showed Halli, who was three at the time, that they were the same which made the toddler beam with joy, she said.\n\n\n\n\"Halli was happy because in Iceland he is always the only one who doesn't have any legs, so it was a lovely thing to do,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"Oscar means a lot to us and we know him well.\"\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir said the athlete was patriotic and showed them pictures of South Africa.\n\n\n\n\"He loves his country, he loves the people, he loves the food and is always bragging about it,\" she said.\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir said she would continue to support her friend despite returning to Iceland on Thursday. He mother would stay another week.\n\n",

The inside of the lid had blood smears on it and the watches had blood spatters on them.\n\n\"I mentioned to all the forensic team that the watches are a big concern because they are very expensive.\n\n\"One of the forensic team mentioned that one of the watches, the green and black one, was worth between R50,000 and R100,000,\" Van Rensburg said.\n\nEarlier that morning Pistorius's sister Aimee had received permission to take one of the watches and some of her brother's clothes. She did so accompanied by police officers.\n\nVan Rensburg said to questioning by prosecutor Gerrie Nel that while they were getting ready to leave, a Warrant Officer Van Staden came to him in the garage and told him a second watch had gone missing.\n\n\"I called everybody into the garage. We body searched everyone. We searched the bags, we searched the whole house. We even searched the vehicles of all the forensic experts. We could not find it.\"\n\nVan Rensburg subsequently opened a theft docket which was handed to the provincial commissioner's office. The matter was still under investigation.\n\n\"I was furious and the next morning I implemented access control [to Pistorius's house].\"\n\nPistorius claims someone broke into his house and hid in the toilet. He shot through the toilet door, killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in the early hours of February 14 last year. Van Rensburg was the first police officer on the scene.\n\nPistorius is accused of the premeditated murder of model and law graduate Steenkamp. He is also charged with illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition, and two counts of discharging a firearm in public.\n\nHe allegedly fired a shot from a Glock pistol under a table at a Johannesburg restaurant in January 2013.\n\nOn September 30, 2012 he allegedly fired a shot from his 9mm pistol through the open sunroof of a car while driving with friends in Modderfontein.",

          "fulltext": "Too much: Oscar Pistorius gesture during a hearing of his murder trial at the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria yesterday. Picture: AFP\n\nMichael Appel\n\n\n\n If we in the media are feeling fatigued by now, one wouldn't even want to venture a guess how murder accused Oscar Pistorius is feeling as the second week of his trial winds to a close today.\n\n\n\n Without a doubt, it's been a tough week for the Paralympian, emotionally in particular.\n\n\n\n He's had his friends take the stand to talk the world through what was intimate moments among pals and he's been painted as a cocky, arrogant, responsibility-dodging hothead by telling testimony from friend, or former friend, Darren Fresco.\n\n\n\n Fresco gave insight into what transpired in his car on the day in September 2012 when Pistorius allegedly fired off a round through his sunroof “without warning”.\n\n\n\n Fresco, also involved in the Tasha restaurant's accidental shooting incident in January last year, gave his version of events that led to the athlete discharging his firearm in the busy restaurant.\n\n\n\n His version of events, what pro boxer Kevin Lerena attested to happened in Tasha's and Pistorius's version of events all differ.\n\n\n\n Interesting how three different versions of the same event have so far been offered to the court.\n\n\n\n Regardless of the strength of Fresco's evidence as a state witness, many will argue that his testimony achieved what it set out to do - taint the wholesome role-model image of the Blade Runner.\n\n\n\n What perhaps stands out most as the second week of his trial comes to an end, is the world's fascination with the Paralympian's reaction to the graphic post-mortem testimony led in court.\n\n\n\n Pathologist Prof Gert Saayman spared no detail in describing, very clinically, the gunshot wounds sustained by law graduate and model Reeva Steenkamp.\n\n\n\n We know that the bullets that were used were Black Talon hollow points, designed to cause “maximum tissue damage”.\n\n\n\n Significantly, Saayman made mention of the fact that “it would be abnormal for someone not to scream”, even after being shot in the head.\n\n\n\n This from an experienced and respected pathologist strongly casts doubt on the defence's version that Steenkamp would not have been able to scream due to the incapacitating head wound.\n\n\n\n On Tuesday, the fatality of her wounds was described to the court resulting in a cacophony of what media houses labelled “retching noises” coming from the visibly distraught athlete.\n\n\n\n The entrance of social media platform Twitter into everyday journalism has given every hack the ability to bring their followers into the court room with them.\n\n\n\n Every gesture Pistorius makes, every smile, every frown, every head-in-hands moment is broadcast almost simultaneously to cell phones, tablets and computers around the world.\n\n\n\n Retired Col Schoombie van Rensburg, the former station commander at Boschkop police station, yesterday painstakingly walked the court through his every footstep as blood splatter after blood splatter photo of his trail through the house was presented to the court.\n\n\n\n The defence is expected to come out strongly on just how so much blood splatter ended up on what many would consider unlikely places in the home.\n\n\n\n There was blood splatter on a pillar downstairs, his duvet, the stairway walls, in the bath, in the basin and even on a small cabinet containing eight of Pistorius's wristwatches in his bedroom.\n\n\n\n Before week three even gets under way on Monday, the National Prosecuting Authority has said that the case is likely to drag on well into April.\n\n\n\n If you're already suffering from overexposure to the constant stream of news coming from the trial, settle down, it may be a long one.\n\n\n\n michaela@thenewage.co.za\n\n",

Where there's web-based interest, the memes are sure to follow, with hundreds of Pistorius-related memes being generated and shared across platforms.\n\nThe most memed player in the Pistorius drama to date has been defence advocate Barry Roux, with his bulldog style and particular way of speaking.\n\nRoux's most repeated phrases have found their way not only onto shareable memes, but also into Twitter and Facebook streams. “I put it to you” has become a commonplace term on social media in a matter of days. It's a phenomenon Stephen Grootes explores in The Considered View.\n\nA particular favourite for meme fodder is the testimony that has been led concerning the bathroom door through which Pistorius shot his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. This week has seen extensive testimony regarding the marks on the door and how they might have come to be there.\n\nMemes aren't the only place that the trial is being spoofed - an Instagram account called LegoPistorius is also gaining traction. The creators use Lego figures to recreate courtroom scenes. \n\n\n\n Then there's the parody Barry Roux Twitter account (@BarryRouxLaw), which already has thousands of followers.\n\n\n\n There are also apps and threads springing up in response to the drama in the courtroom.\n\nOthers have sought to capitalise on the viral nature of the trial and came up short.

          "fulltext": "Both Gert Saayman and Johan Vermeulen are applied scientists. Both hold a number of formal qualifications that saw them trained in forensic investigations. Both have plied their respective trades for decades. Both have much experience in acting as expert witnesses in criminal trials, and explaining their sometimes complex findings to courts.\n\nBut in the second week of the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp, forensic pathologist Saayman and ­materials analyst Vermeulen had very ­different experiences in the witness box, vividly illustrating both the advantages and the pitfalls of matching the scientific method to a system of adversarial justice.\n\nAll indications are that judgment in the Pistorius murder trial - a case that prosecutor Gerrie Nel himself described as circumstantial - will hinge on various branches of forensic science, from ballistics to pathology.\n\nThere is every reason to believe the findings drawn from the science will be highly contested; Pistorius's defence team has lined up experts to counter witnesses called by the state.\n\nDefence lead advocate Barry Roux SC did not wait to call his own witnesses to begin the legal assault on the state's version of events on the night Steenkamp died.\n\nUnusual strategy\n\n Continuing an unusual strategy implemented during bail proceedings a year ago, when Pistorius submitted a highly detailed account of the night, the defence team made no secret of the sequence of events it will present to the court - a sequence it will argue shows Pistorius did not commit murder.\n\nIt was an approach that saw Vermeulen mauled by Roux during cross-examination, pushed to participate in sometimes bizarre ­physical demonstrations of the cricket bat and door he had been tasked with examining, and forced into joining ever more complicated speculation about plausible and implausible sequences of events.\n\nSaayman, by contrast, had an easier time under cross-examination earlier in the week, with most of his findings and many of his conclusions from Steenkamp's autopsy accepted as presented.\n\nThe difference seemed rooted in a difference of approach.\n\nThe meticulous Saayman described a process that differentiated between observation and interpretation, providing a few hypotheses gingerly, with many caveats. He presented work almost entirely free of assumptions - but also of hard, testable findings.\n\nTwo approaches\n\n Whereas Saayman laid out measurements and then spoke in terms of probabilities, Vermeulen provided what he considered likely scenarios, then explained why he had reached the conclusions he had. Saayman's language was peppered with precise medical terms impenetrable to the lay person and requiring less precise explanation; Vermeulen used vaguely defined words and phrases imprecise enough to make an academic cringe.\n\nYet the decidedly more blue-collar approach to finding the truth taken by police employee Vermeulen may be preferable to Saayman's more scientifically pure approach in a court.\n\n\"You want information put to you, but you also want to have a version that silks [senior advocates] can bash around [to] see if it stands up,\" explained a court officer not involved in the matter. \"If a guy is saying, 'this is what I think happened', that is a witness we can evaluate. If a guy says, 'here is what I measured', it can lack meaning.\"\n\nBut had each been defending a thesis outside a court, or been subjected to peer review of a paper, Saayman would have succeeded where Vermeulen would fail.\n\nBoth men presented evidence not in keeping with the version of events Pistorius described on the night of Valentine's Day 2013, before and after he shot Steenkamp. Pistorius said the couple had turned in for the night hours before midnight; Saayman said Steenkamp might have eaten something several hours later. Pistorius said he was wearing his prosthetic legs when he broke down a door to reach Steenkamp; Vermeulen said it appeared that Pistorius was so low to the ground at the time that he must have been standing on his stumps.\n\nWorlds apart\n\n The manner in which they presented their findings was worlds apart. Saayman delivered what was, in effect, a mini-lecture to explain the caveats that went with his finding of when Steenkamp had had her last meal.\n\nHe noted that this problem had been closely studied because it is both important in investigating murders particularly fraught with difficulty.\n\nHe described the imprecision of the science involved. He cited the possibility of very large meals, or very small meals, affecting the time taken to digest food.\n\nHe cautioned that different types of food are digested at different speeds, that different people digest food at different speeds, and that the same person could digest food at different rates from one day to the next.\n\nHe explained that food continued to be digested after death. Only then would he allow that the probable time between meal and death was, probably, approximately, two hours.\n\nNo prosthetics\n\n Vermeulen, on the other hand, presented his theory that Pistorius was not wearing prosthetics when he broke down the toilet door in what Roux would later refer to as an \"ambush\" (the finding was not contained in the written report Vermeulen had compiled).\n\nVermeulen then found himself defending that theory from a furious attack by the defence counsel, at one point being made to balance on his knees but with his feet in the air - trying to swing a cricket bat. Roux pushed hard: What constitutes an \"unnatural\" position in which to swing a cricket bat? How many ­positions were actually tested?\n\nIf the police stood in service of the accused as much as the prosecution, as Vermeulen said, why was a version of events presented by Pistorius not tested under laboratory conditions?\n\nVermeulen, at times with a bemused expression, found his hypothesis gradually eroded through small concessions and new caveats.\n\nTo lay watchers, it appeared that Vermeulen was demolished by the defence, while Saayman held his ground.\n\nBasic principles\n\n To scientists working in the rarefied air of academia, it appeared that Vermeulen had ignored basic principles; Saayman stuck to them.\n\nTo police with a job to do, one officer commented, it seemed that Saayman lacked the guts to point the finger of accusation, whereas Vermeulen did his job.\n\nTo some judicial officers, it seemed Vermeulen provided a testable version of events, even if it were found wanting, but Saayman's approach left the court to interpret his data with too little guidance.\n\nAll of which is, of course, irrelevant, and how Judge Thokozile Masipa interpreted the evidence of each expert will only be clear when she provides a summary of evidence before delivering the verdict.\n\nIf theory holds and the history of complex cases is any guide, the court will not see any individual witness or single piece of evidence as either bolstering or undermining Pistorius's version of events, nor will it point to a smoking gun proving whether or not a murder was committed.\n\nInstead, it will consider all the information before it: as pieces of a puzzle to be weighed and tested against one another - measured for import and plausibility, and carefully fitted into the whole.\n\nCounsel for the state and defence in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius on Thursday said they had agreed to continue his trial for an additional two weeks before planning further dates.\n\nThe new dates had not been ratified by the court at the time of publication, but that was considered a formality.\n\nThe case was due to be heard between March 3 and March 20, but halfway through that period it was evident that far more time would be required - with prosecutors still painstakingly building a case and state witnesses subjected to lengthy cross-examination.\n\nThe trial is now expected to continue without interruption until April 4, with an assessment to be done towards the middle of April on how much further court time will be required and to agree on dates. - Phillip de Wet",

That firearm as it is lying there, it is ready to fire,\" said Van Rensburg, who was the first policeman to arrive at the scene of the shooting.\n\n\n\n Van Rensburg, who commanded the Boschkop police station in Pretoria at the time, said when he walked into the house he saw a body covered in blood stained towels and clothes and found Pistorius in the kitchen.\n\n\n\n He was emotional and did not immediately reply when asked what had happened.\n\n\n\n \"I asked him what happened and he did not answer,\" Van Rensburg said.\n\n\n\n At this Pistorius's defence lawyer Barry Roux SC stood up to contradict the witness: \"My Lady, actually he was very emotional, not emotional.\"\n\n\n\n Pistorius has pleaded not guilty to premeditated murder, claiming that he believed there was an intruder hiding in a locked toilet cubicle in his home when he fired four shots into it, fatally wounding Steenkamp.\n\n\n\n According to his version of events, he then put on his prostheses, grabbed a cricket bat and broke open the toilet door.\n\n\n\n This account was at issue for most of Thursday's proceedings as senior police forensic expert Johannes Vermeulen was grilled about the conclusions he had made from studying the marks on the meranti door.\n\n\n\n Vermeulen maintained under cross-examination from Roux that -- based on the height and shape of the marks -- Pistorius was in fact standing on his stumps when he swung the bat at the door.\n\n\n\n Making a case that the police investigation had been unprofessional, Roux repeatedly asked why Vermeulen had failed to probe into the provenance of a footprint on a panel of the meranti door.\n\n\n\n The lawyer argued that it provided proof that Pistorius had been wearing his prostheses and had tried to kick down the door, adding that an independent expert had found bits of fabric attached to the wood.\n\n\n\n Roux then proceeded to show the High Court in Pretoria a picture of his client's bloodied prosthetic legs to back up his argument.\n\n\n\n The right leg had blood streaks on it, and one of the grey ankle socks had a dark stain near the toes.\n\n\n\n Vermeulen conceded that only part of the prosthesis -- the shin -- had been examined by him, saying he had received Pistorius's prosthetic legs without the socks, and his brief had been limited.\n\n\n\n \"I was not requested to do analysis on the prosthetic foot, except for that mark that was on the shin,\" said Vermeulen.\n\n\n\n Roux wryly commented: \"It would have been fantastic as a qualified foot print examiner seeing that mark... to just do the test.\"\n\n\n\n State prosecutor Gerrie Nel returned to the subject when he re-examined Vermeulen, asking him whether the accused may have kicked the door for another reason than to gain access to the toilet cubicle, for example to intimidate the person was inside.\n\n\n\n Vermeulen said this would be speculation.\n\n\n\n \"Let's speculate,\" Nel responded, to which the witness responded that the State's scenario was possible.\n\n\n\n Nel also asked Vermeulen whether he could definitively say that the dents in the door were all made only after the bullet holes.\n\n\n\n He could not, Vermeulen answered.\n\n\n\n The questions were in line with the State's submission that Pistorius and Steenkamp had argued on the night he shot her, something the accused has denied in his sworn statement to the court as \"unfair and incorrect\".\n\n\n\n The trial, which is being televised live, was scheduled to continue until March 20 but an assistant prosecutor indicated on Thursday that it was now likely carry on at least until April 4.\n\n\n\n        \n\n -Sapa \n\n\n\n",

He launched into a lengthy explanation of how the first photos taken of a crime scene were the most important and showed the scene unchanged.\n\n\n\nMore photos were then taken later as police \"investigated further\".\n\n\n\nVan Rensburg has since resigned from the police to coach sport.\n\n\n\nPistorius claims he shot Steenkamp through the locked door of his toilet cubicle thinking she was an intruder. He bashed open the door with a cricket bat and carried her bleeding, lifeless body downstairs.\n\n\n\nPistorius is accused of the premeditated murder of model and law graduate Steenkamp. He is also charged with illegal possession of ammunition, and two counts of discharging a firearm in public.\n\n\n\nHe allegedly fired a shot from a Glock pistol under a table at a Johannesburg restaurant in January 2013.

At one point Roux paused, lowered his head and rubbed his eyes and forehead.\n\nThen the tension rose as Roux asked: \"Colonel, you remember at the beginning of my cross-examination I said what you are doing is to take the place of Hilton Botha, to make him an unnecessary witness?\"\n\nThis led to the exchange of whether Botha had accompanied Van Rensburg upstairs.\n\nPistorius claims he shot Steenkamp through the locked door of his toilet cubicle thinking she was an intruder.\n\nHe bashed open the door with a cricket bat and carried her bleeding, lifeless body downstairs.\n\nPistorius is accused of the premeditated murder of model and law graduate Steenkamp.

          "fulltext": "Both Gert Saayman and Johan Vermeulen are applied scientists. Both hold a number of formal qualifications that saw them trained in forensic investigations. Both have plied their respective trades for decades. Both have much experience in acting as expert witnesses in criminal trials, and explaining their sometimes complex findings to courts.\n\nBut in the second week of the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp, forensic pathologist Saayman and ­materials analyst Vermeulen had very ­different experiences in the witness box, vividly illustrating both the advantages and the pitfalls of matching the scientific method to a system of adversarial justice.\n\nAll indications are that judgment in the Pistorius murder trial - a case that prosecutor Gerrie Nel himself described as circumstantial - will hinge on various branches of forensic science, from ballistics to pathology.\n\nThere is every reason to believe the findings drawn from the science will be highly contested; Pistorius's defence team has lined up experts to counter witnesses called by the state.\n\nDefence lead advocate Barry Roux SC did not wait to call his own witnesses to begin the legal assault on the state's version of events on the night Steenkamp died.\n\nUnusual strategy\n\n Continuing an unusual strategy implemented during bail proceedings a year ago, when Pistorius submitted a highly detailed account of the night, the defence team made no secret of the sequence of events it will present to the court - a sequence it will argue shows Pistorius did not commit murder.\n\nIt was an approach that saw Vermeulen mauled by Roux during cross-examination, pushed to participate in sometimes bizarre ­physical demonstrations of the cricket bat and door he had been tasked with examining, and forced into joining ever more complicated speculation about plausible and implausible sequences of events.\n\nSaayman, by contrast, had an easier time under cross-examination earlier in the week, with most of his findings and many of his conclusions from Steenkamp's autopsy accepted as presented.\n\nThe difference seemed rooted in a difference of approach.\n\nThe meticulous Saayman described a process that differentiated between observation and interpretation, providing a few hypotheses gingerly, with many caveats. He presented work almost entirely free of assumptions - but also of hard, testable findings.\n\nTwo approaches\n\n Whereas Saayman laid out measurements and then spoke in terms of probabilities, Vermeulen provided what he considered likely scenarios, then explained why he had reached the conclusions he had. Saayman's language was peppered with precise medical terms impenetrable to the lay person and requiring less precise explanation; Vermeulen used vaguely defined words and phrases imprecise enough to make an academic cringe.\n\nYet the decidedly more blue-collar approach to finding the truth taken by police employee Vermeulen may be preferable to Saayman's more scientifically pure approach in a court.\n\n\"You want information put to you, but you also want to have a version that silks [senior advocates] can bash around [to] see if it stands up,\" explained a court officer not involved in the matter. \"If a guy is saying, 'this is what I think happened', that is a witness we can evaluate. If a guy says, 'here is what I measured', it can lack meaning.\"\n\nBut had each been defending a thesis outside a court, or been subjected to peer review of a paper, Saayman would have succeeded where Vermeulen would fail.\n\nBoth men presented evidence not in keeping with the version of events Pistorius described on the night of Valentine's Day 2013, before and after he shot Steenkamp. Pistorius said the couple had turned in for the night hours before midnight; Saayman said Steenkamp might have eaten something several hours later. Pistorius said he was wearing his prosthetic legs when he broke down a door to reach Steenkamp; Vermeulen said it appeared that Pistorius was so low to the ground at the time that he must have been standing on his stumps.\n\nWorlds apart\n\n The manner in which they presented their findings was worlds apart. Saayman delivered what was, in effect, a mini-lecture to explain the caveats that went with his finding of when Steenkamp had had her last meal.\n\nHe noted that this problem had been closely studied because it is both important in investigating murders particularly fraught with difficulty.\n\nHe described the imprecision of the science involved. He cited the possibility of very large meals, or very small meals, affecting the time taken to digest food.\n\nHe cautioned that different types of food are digested at different speeds, that different people digest food at different speeds, and that the same person could digest food at different rates from one day to the next.\n\nHe explained that food continued to be digested after death. Only then would he allow that the probable time between meal and death was, probably, approximately, two hours.\n\nNo prosthetics\n\n Vermeulen, on the other hand, presented his theory that Pistorius was not wearing prosthetics when he broke down the toilet door in what Roux would later refer to as an \"ambush\" (the finding was not contained in the written report Vermeulen had compiled).\n\nVermeulen then found himself defending that theory from a furious attack by the defence counsel, at one point being made to balance on his knees but with his feet in the air - trying to swing a cricket bat. Roux pushed hard: What constitutes an \"unnatural\" position in which to swing a cricket bat? How many ­positions were actually tested?\n\nIf the police stood in service of the accused as much as the prosecution, as Vermeulen said, why was a version of events presented by Pistorius not tested under laboratory conditions?\n\nVermeulen, at times with a bemused expression, found his hypothesis gradually eroded through small concessions and new caveats.\n\nTo lay watchers, it appeared that Vermeulen was demolished by the defence, while Saayman held his ground.\n\nBasic principles\n\n To scientists working in the rarefied air of academia, it appeared that Vermeulen had ignored basic principles; Saayman stuck to them.\n\nTo police with a job to do, one officer commented, it seemed that Saayman lacked the guts to point the finger of accusation, whereas Vermeulen did his job.\n\nTo some judicial officers, it seemed Vermeulen provided a testable version of events, even if it were found wanting, but Saayman's approach left the court to interpret his data with too little guidance.\n\nAll of which is, of course, irrelevant, and how Judge Thokozile Masipa interpreted the evidence of each expert will only be clear when she provides a summary of evidence before delivering the verdict.\n\nIf theory holds and the history of complex cases is any guide, the court will not see any individual witness or single piece of evidence as either bolstering or undermining Pistorius's version of events, nor will it point to a smoking gun proving whether or not a murder was committed.\n\nInstead, it will consider all the information before it: as pieces of a puzzle to be weighed and tested against one another - measured for import and plausibility, and carefully fitted into the whole.\n\nCounsel for the state and defence in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius on Thursday said they had agreed to continue his trial for an additional two weeks before planning further dates.\n\nThe new dates had not been ratified by the court at the time of publication, but that was considered a formality.\n\nThe case was due to be heard between March 3 and March 20, but halfway through that period it was evident that far more time would be required - with prosecutors still painstakingly building a case and state witnesses subjected to lengthy cross-examination.\n\nThe trial is now expected to continue without interruption until April 4, with an assessment to be done towards the middle of April on how much further court time will be required and to agree on dates. - Phillip de Wet",

He explained that as the first on a crime scene an officer sees things but is also assisting a team.\n\n\n\n\"So you discover things later,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThese are added to later reports.\n\n\n\nVan Rensburg said that looking over the bedroom balcony on the morning of the shooting he did see ladders outside.\n\n\n\nBut he insisted there was no window in the toilet cubicle, just the bathroom windows.\n\n\n\nBut Roux insisted there was.\n\n\n\nPistorius has pleaded not guilty to murder, which the State alleges was premeditated and could have been during an argument.\n\n\n\nPistorius is also charged with contraventions of the Firearms Control Act.\n\n\n\nHe allegedly fired a shot from a Glock pistol under a table at a Johannesburg restaurant in January 2013.\n\n\n\nOn 30 September 2012 he allegedly fired a shot from his 9mm pistol through the open sunroof of a car while driving with friends in Modderfontein.\n\n",

          "fulltext": "Both Gert Saayman and Johan Vermeulen are applied scientists. Both hold a number of formal qualifications that saw them trained in forensic investigations. Both have plied their respective trades for decades. Both have much experience in acting as expert witnesses in criminal trials, and explaining their sometimes complex findings to courts.\n\nBut in the second week of the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp, forensic pathologist Saayman and ­materials analyst Vermeulen had very ­different experiences in the witness box, vividly illustrating both the advantages and the pitfalls of matching the scientific method to a system of adversarial justice.\n\nAll indications are that judgment in the Pistorius murder trial - a case that prosecutor Gerrie Nel himself described as circumstantial - will hinge on various branches of forensic science, from ballistics to pathology.\n\nThere is every reason to believe the findings drawn from the science will be highly contested; Pistorius's defence team has lined up experts to counter witnesses called by the state.\n\nDefence lead advocate Barry Roux SC did not wait to call his own witnesses to begin the legal assault on the state's version of events on the night Steenkamp died.\n\nUnusual strategy\n\n Continuing an unusual strategy implemented during bail proceedings a year ago, when Pistorius submitted a highly detailed account of the night, the defence team made no secret of the sequence of events it will present to the court - a sequence it will argue shows Pistorius did not commit murder.\n\nIt was an approach that saw Vermeulen mauled by Roux during cross-examination, pushed to participate in sometimes bizarre ­physical demonstrations of the cricket bat and door he had been tasked with examining, and forced into joining ever more complicated speculation about plausible and implausible sequences of events.\n\nSaayman, by contrast, had an easier time under cross-examination earlier in the week, with most of his findings and many of his conclusions from Steenkamp's autopsy accepted as presented.\n\nThe difference seemed rooted in a difference of approach.\n\nThe meticulous Saayman described a process that differentiated between observation and interpretation, providing a few hypotheses gingerly, with many caveats. He presented work almost entirely free of assumptions - but also of hard, testable findings.\n\nTwo approaches\n\n Whereas Saayman laid out measurements and then spoke in terms of probabilities, Vermeulen provided what he considered likely scenarios, then explained why he had reached the conclusions he had. Saayman's language was peppered with precise medical terms impenetrable to the lay person and requiring less precise explanation; Vermeulen used vaguely defined words and phrases imprecise enough to make an academic cringe.\n\nYet the decidedly more blue-collar approach to finding the truth taken by police employee Vermeulen may be preferable to Saayman's more scientifically pure approach in a court.\n\n\"You want information put to you, but you also want to have a version that silks [senior advocates] can bash around [to] see if it stands up,\" explained a court officer not involved in the matter. \"If a guy is saying, 'this is what I think happened', that is a witness we can evaluate. If a guy says, 'here is what I measured', it can lack meaning.\"\n\nBut had each been defending a thesis outside a court, or been subjected to peer review of a paper, Saayman would have succeeded where Vermeulen would fail.\n\nBoth men presented evidence not in keeping with the version of events Pistorius described on the night of Valentine's Day 2013, before and after he shot Steenkamp. Pistorius said the couple had turned in for the night hours before midnight; Saayman said Steenkamp might have eaten something several hours later. Pistorius said he was wearing his prosthetic legs when he broke down a door to reach Steenkamp; Vermeulen said it appeared that Pistorius was so low to the ground at the time that he must have been standing on his stumps.\n\nWorlds apart\n\n The manner in which they presented their findings was worlds apart. Saayman delivered what was, in effect, a mini-lecture to explain the caveats that went with his finding of when Steenkamp had had her last meal.\n\nHe noted that this problem had been closely studied because it is both important in investigating murders particularly fraught with difficulty.\n\nHe described the imprecision of the science involved. He cited the possibility of very large meals, or very small meals, affecting the time taken to digest food.\n\nHe cautioned that different types of food are digested at different speeds, that different people digest food at different speeds, and that the same person could digest food at different rates from one day to the next.\n\nHe explained that food continued to be digested after death. Only then would he allow that the probable time between meal and death was, probably, approximately, two hours.\n\nNo prosthetics\n\n Vermeulen, on the other hand, presented his theory that Pistorius was not wearing prosthetics when he broke down the toilet door in what Roux would later refer to as an \"ambush\" (the finding was not contained in the written report Vermeulen had compiled).\n\nVermeulen then found himself defending that theory from a furious attack by the defence counsel, at one point being made to balance on his knees but with his feet in the air - trying to swing a cricket bat. Roux pushed hard: What constitutes an \"unnatural\" position in which to swing a cricket bat? How many ­positions were actually tested?\n\nIf the police stood in service of the accused as much as the prosecution, as Vermeulen said, why was a version of events presented by Pistorius not tested under laboratory conditions?\n\nVermeulen, at times with a bemused expression, found his hypothesis gradually eroded through small concessions and new caveats.\n\nTo lay watchers, it appeared that Vermeulen was demolished by the defence, while Saayman held his ground.\n\nBasic principles\n\n To scientists working in the rarefied air of academia, it appeared that Vermeulen had ignored basic principles; Saayman stuck to them.\n\nTo police with a job to do, one officer commented, it seemed that Saayman lacked the guts to point the finger of accusation, whereas Vermeulen did his job.\n\nTo some judicial officers, it seemed Vermeulen provided a testable version of events, even if it were found wanting, but Saayman's approach left the court to interpret his data with too little guidance.\n\nAll of which is, of course, irrelevant, and how Judge Thokozile Masipa interpreted the evidence of each expert will only be clear when she provides a summary of evidence before delivering the verdict.\n\nIf theory holds and the history of complex cases is any guide, the court will not see any individual witness or single piece of evidence as either bolstering or undermining Pistorius's version of events, nor will it point to a smoking gun proving whether or not a murder was committed.\n\nInstead, it will consider all the information before it: as pieces of a puzzle to be weighed and tested against one another - measured for import and plausibility, and carefully fitted into the whole.\n\nCounsel for the state and defence in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius on Thursday said they had agreed to continue his trial for an additional two weeks before planning further dates.\n\nThe new dates had not been ratified by the court at the time of publication, but that was considered a formality.\n\nThe case was due to be heard between March 3 and March 20, but halfway through that period it was evident that far more time would be required - with prosecutors still painstakingly building a case and state witnesses subjected to lengthy cross-examination.\n\nThe trial is now expected to continue without interruption until April 4, with an assessment to be done towards the middle of April on how much further court time will be required and to agree on dates. - Phillip de Wet",

Listen to the full interview here.\n\nKhoury says the biggest spike in content creation around the trial was on day one, with 80,000 pieces of original content being generated worldwide.\n\nMonday saw another spike in interest and by Friday, Khoury was reporting around 1,000 unique inserts about the trial every hour.\n\nHer company's heat map reveals just how much play the story is getting worldwide.\n\nIn recent days, Australia's media coverage of the case has ramped up considerably, with that nation taking position number three worldwide.\n\nAround 42 percent of all news coverage in South Africa is devoted to the trial at the moment.\n\nIn stark contrast, coverage of the Marikana commission of inquiry is only making up 4 percent of total South African news coverage.\n\nKhoury says witnesses are also feeling the glare of the media and social media spotlight, but mentions of their names quickly diminish as they leave the stand.\n\nThe state's first witness Michelle Burger remains the most mentioned witness so far, with Darren Fresco a close second.\n\nDuring his brief stint on the stand, more than 5,000 pieces of content were generated about him.\n\nLegal teams are also making a splash on social media, but one name stands out above the rest is defence advocate Barry Roux.\n\nHe received the most mentions, which saw him become a meme star.\n\nIn terms of journalists, South African investigative reporter Debora Patta is leading the pack in terms of her reach on Twitter.\n\nPatta is covering the trial for international broadcasters.\n\nKhoury's research reveals Patta's tweets are getting six to seven times more referrals than her three closest rivals, one of whom is EWN's Barry Bateman.",

          "fulltext": "Both Gert Saayman and Johan Vermeulen are applied scientists. Both hold a number of formal qualifications that saw them trained in forensic investigations. Both have plied their respective trades for decades. Both have much experience in acting as expert witnesses in criminal trials, and explaining their sometimes complex findings to courts.\n\nBut in the second week of the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp, forensic pathologist Saayman and ­materials analyst Vermeulen had very ­different experiences in the witness box, vividly illustrating both the advantages and the pitfalls of matching the scientific method to a system of adversarial justice.\n\nAll indications are that judgment in the Pistorius murder trial - a case that prosecutor Gerrie Nel himself described as circumstantial - will hinge on various branches of forensic science, from ballistics to pathology.\n\nThere is every reason to believe the findings drawn from the science will be highly contested; Pistorius's defence team has lined up experts to counter witnesses called by the state.\n\nDefence lead advocate Barry Roux SC did not wait to call his own witnesses to begin the legal assault on the state's version of events on the night Steenkamp died.\n\nUnusual strategy\n\n Continuing an unusual strategy implemented during bail proceedings a year ago, when Pistorius submitted a highly detailed account of the night, the defence team made no secret of the sequence of events it will present to the court - a sequence it will argue shows Pistorius did not commit murder.\n\nIt was an approach that saw Vermeulen mauled by Roux during cross-examination, pushed to participate in sometimes bizarre ­physical demonstrations of the cricket bat and door he had been tasked with examining, and forced into joining ever more complicated speculation about plausible and implausible sequences of events.\n\nSaayman, by contrast, had an easier time under cross-examination earlier in the week, with most of his findings and many of his conclusions from Steenkamp's autopsy accepted as presented.\n\nThe difference seemed rooted in a difference of approach.\n\nThe meticulous Saayman described a process that differentiated between observation and interpretation, providing a few hypotheses gingerly, with many caveats. He presented work almost entirely free of assumptions - but also of hard, testable findings.\n\nTwo approaches\n\n Whereas Saayman laid out measurements and then spoke in terms of probabilities, Vermeulen provided what he considered likely scenarios, then explained why he had reached the conclusions he had. Saayman's language was peppered with precise medical terms impenetrable to the lay person and requiring less precise explanation; Vermeulen used vaguely defined words and phrases imprecise enough to make an academic cringe.\n\nYet the decidedly more blue-collar approach to finding the truth taken by police employee Vermeulen may be preferable to Saayman's more scientifically pure approach in a court.\n\n\"You want information put to you, but you also want to have a version that silks [senior advocates] can bash around [to] see if it stands up,\" explained a court officer not involved in the matter. \"If a guy is saying, 'this is what I think happened', that is a witness we can evaluate. If a guy says, 'here is what I measured', it can lack meaning.\"\n\nBut had each been defending a thesis outside a court, or been subjected to peer review of a paper, Saayman would have succeeded where Vermeulen would fail.\n\nBoth men presented evidence not in keeping with the version of events Pistorius described on the night of Valentine's Day 2013, before and after he shot Steenkamp. Pistorius said the couple had turned in for the night hours before midnight; Saayman said Steenkamp might have eaten something several hours later. Pistorius said he was wearing his prosthetic legs when he broke down a door to reach Steenkamp; Vermeulen said it appeared that Pistorius was so low to the ground at the time that he must have been standing on his stumps.\n\nWorlds apart\n\n The manner in which they presented their findings was worlds apart. Saayman delivered what was, in effect, a mini-lecture to explain the caveats that went with his finding of when Steenkamp had had her last meal.\n\nHe noted that this problem had been closely studied because it is both important in investigating murders particularly fraught with difficulty.\n\nHe described the imprecision of the science involved. He cited the possibility of very large meals, or very small meals, affecting the time taken to digest food.\n\nHe cautioned that different types of food are digested at different speeds, that different people digest food at different speeds, and that the same person could digest food at different rates from one day to the next.\n\nHe explained that food continued to be digested after death. Only then would he allow that the probable time between meal and death was, probably, approximately, two hours.\n\nNo prosthetics\n\n Vermeulen, on the other hand, presented his theory that Pistorius was not wearing prosthetics when he broke down the toilet door in what Roux would later refer to as an \"ambush\" (the finding was not contained in the written report Vermeulen had compiled).\n\nVermeulen then found himself defending that theory from a furious attack by the defence counsel, at one point being made to balance on his knees but with his feet in the air - trying to swing a cricket bat. Roux pushed hard: What constitutes an \"unnatural\" position in which to swing a cricket bat? How many ­positions were actually tested?\n\nIf the police stood in service of the accused as much as the prosecution, as Vermeulen said, why was a version of events presented by Pistorius not tested under laboratory conditions?\n\nVermeulen, at times with a bemused expression, found his hypothesis gradually eroded through small concessions and new caveats.\n\nTo lay watchers, it appeared that Vermeulen was demolished by the defence, while Saayman held his ground.\n\nBasic principles\n\n To scientists working in the rarefied air of academia, it appeared that Vermeulen had ignored basic principles; Saayman stuck to them.\n\nTo police with a job to do, one officer commented, it seemed that Saayman lacked the guts to point the finger of accusation, whereas Vermeulen did his job.\n\nTo some judicial officers, it seemed Vermeulen provided a testable version of events, even if it were found wanting, but Saayman's approach left the court to interpret his data with too little guidance.\n\nAll of which is, of course, irrelevant, and how Judge Thokozile Masipa interpreted the evidence of each expert will only be clear when she provides a summary of evidence before delivering the verdict.\n\nIf theory holds and the history of complex cases is any guide, the court will not see any individual witness or single piece of evidence as either bolstering or undermining Pistorius's version of events, nor will it point to a smoking gun proving whether or not a murder was committed.\n\nInstead, it will consider all the information before it: as pieces of a puzzle to be weighed and tested against one another - measured for import and plausibility, and carefully fitted into the whole.\n\nCounsel for the state and defence in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius on Thursday said they had agreed to continue his trial for an additional two weeks before planning further dates.\n\nThe new dates had not been ratified by the court at the time of publication, but that was considered a formality.\n\nThe case was due to be heard between March 3 and March 20, but halfway through that period it was evident that far more time would be required - with prosecutors still painstakingly building a case and state witnesses subjected to lengthy cross-examination.\n\nThe trial is now expected to continue without interruption until April 4, with an assessment to be done towards the middle of April on how much further court time will be required and to agree on dates. - Phillip de Wet",
