          "fulltext": u"Both Gert Saayman and Johan Vermeulen are applied scientists. Both hold a number of formal qualifications that saw them trained in forensic investigations. Both have plied their respective trades for decades. Both have much experience in acting as expert witnesses in criminal trials, and explaining their sometimes complex findings to courts.\n\nBut in the second week of the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp, forensic pathologist Saayman and ­materials analyst Vermeulen had very ­different experiences in the witness box, vividly illustrating both the advantages and the pitfalls of matching the scientific method to a system of adversarial justice.\n\nAll indications are that judgment in the Pistorius murder trial - a case that prosecutor Gerrie Nel himself described as circumstantial - will hinge on various branches of forensic science, from ballistics to pathology.\n\nThere is every reason to believe the findings drawn from the science will be highly contested; Pistorius's defence team has lined up experts to counter witnesses called by the state.\n\nDefence lead advocate Barry Roux SC did not wait to call his own witnesses to begin the legal assault on the state's version of events on the night Steenkamp died.\n\nUnusual strategy\n\n Continuing an unusual strategy implemented during bail proceedings a year ago, when Pistorius submitted a highly detailed account of the night, the defence team made no secret of the sequence of events it will present to the court - a sequence it will argue shows Pistorius did not commit murder.\n\nIt was an approach that saw Vermeulen mauled by Roux during cross-examination, pushed to participate in sometimes bizarre ­physical demonstrations of the cricket bat and door he had been tasked with examining, and forced into joining ever more complicated speculation about plausible and implausible sequences of events.\n\nSaayman, by contrast, had an easier time under cross-examination earlier in the week, with most of his findings and many of his conclusions from Steenkamp's autopsy accepted as presented.\n\nThe difference seemed rooted in a difference of approach.\n\nThe meticulous Saayman described a process that differentiated between observation and interpretation, providing a few hypotheses gingerly, with many caveats. He presented work almost entirely free of assumptions - but also of hard, testable findings.\n\nTwo approaches\n\n Whereas Saayman laid out measurements and then spoke in terms of probabilities, Vermeulen provided what he considered likely scenarios, then explained why he had reached the conclusions he had. Saayman's language was peppered with precise medical terms impenetrable to the lay person and requiring less precise explanation; Vermeulen used vaguely defined words and phrases imprecise enough to make an academic cringe.\n\nYet the decidedly more blue-collar approach to finding the truth taken by police employee Vermeulen may be preferable to Saayman's more scientifically pure approach in a court.\n\n\"You want information put to you, but you also want to have a version that silks [senior advocates] can bash around [to] see if it stands up,\" explained a court officer not involved in the matter. \"If a guy is saying, 'this is what I think happened', that is a witness we can evaluate. If a guy says, 'here is what I measured', it can lack meaning.\"\n\nBut had each been defending a thesis outside a court, or been subjected to peer review of a paper, Saayman would have succeeded where Vermeulen would fail.\n\nBoth men presented evidence not in keeping with the version of events Pistorius described on the night of Valentine's Day 2013, before and after he shot Steenkamp. Pistorius said the couple had turned in for the night hours before midnight; Saayman said Steenkamp might have eaten something several hours later. Pistorius said he was wearing his prosthetic legs when he broke down a door to reach Steenkamp; Vermeulen said it appeared that Pistorius was so low to the ground at the time that he must have been standing on his stumps.\n\nWorlds apart\n\n The manner in which they presented their findings was worlds apart. Saayman delivered what was, in effect, a mini-lecture to explain the caveats that went with his finding of when Steenkamp had had her last meal.\n\nHe noted that this problem had been closely studied because it is both important in investigating murders particularly fraught with difficulty.\n\nHe described the imprecision of the science involved. He cited the possibility of very large meals, or very small meals, affecting the time taken to digest food.\n\nHe cautioned that different types of food are digested at different speeds, that different people digest food at different speeds, and that the same person could digest food at different rates from one day to the next.\n\nHe explained that food continued to be digested after death. Only then would he allow that the probable time between meal and death was, probably, approximately, two hours.\n\nNo prosthetics\n\n Vermeulen, on the other hand, presented his theory that Pistorius was not wearing prosthetics when he broke down the toilet door in what Roux would later refer to as an \"ambush\" (the finding was not contained in the written report Vermeulen had compiled).\n\nVermeulen then found himself defending that theory from a furious attack by the defence counsel, at one point being made to balance on his knees but with his feet in the air - trying to swing a cricket bat. Roux pushed hard: What constitutes an \"unnatural\" position in which to swing a cricket bat? How many ­positions were actually tested?\n\nIf the police stood in service of the accused as much as the prosecution, as Vermeulen said, why was a version of events presented by Pistorius not tested under laboratory conditions?\n\nVermeulen, at times with a bemused expression, found his hypothesis gradually eroded through small concessions and new caveats.\n\nTo lay watchers, it appeared that Vermeulen was demolished by the defence, while Saayman held his ground.\n\nBasic principles\n\n To scientists working in the rarefied air of academia, it appeared that Vermeulen had ignored basic principles; Saayman stuck to them.\n\nTo police with a job to do, one officer commented, it seemed that Saayman lacked the guts to point the finger of accusation, whereas Vermeulen did his job.\n\nTo some judicial officers, it seemed Vermeulen provided a testable version of events, even if it were found wanting, but Saayman's approach left the court to interpret his data with too little guidance.\n\nAll of which is, of course, irrelevant, and how Judge Thokozile Masipa interpreted the evidence of each expert will only be clear when she provides a summary of evidence before delivering the verdict.\n\nIf theory holds and the history of complex cases is any guide, the court will not see any individual witness or single piece of evidence as either bolstering or undermining Pistorius's version of events, nor will it point to a smoking gun proving whether or not a murder was committed.\n\nInstead, it will consider all the information before it: as pieces of a puzzle to be weighed and tested against one another - measured for import and plausibility, and carefully fitted into the whole.\n\nCounsel for the state and defence in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius on Thursday said they had agreed to continue his trial for an additional two weeks before planning further dates.\n\nThe new dates had not been ratified by the court at the time of publication, but that was considered a formality.\n\nThe case was due to be heard between March 3 and March 20, but halfway through that period it was evident that far more time would be required - with prosecutors still painstakingly building a case and state witnesses subjected to lengthy cross-examination.\n\nThe trial is now expected to continue without interruption until April 4, with an assessment to be done towards the middle of April on how much further court time will be required and to agree on dates. - Phillip de Wet",

      "fulltext": u"Giliam van Rensburg told the High Court in Pretoria he was dismayed to see a colleague pick up the handgun found on Pistorius's bloodied bathroom floor without protective gloves.\n\n\"So I asked him what are you doing?\" said Van Rensburg, adding that at this the ballistics expert looked down and realised he was bare-handed.\n\n\"And then he said 'Sorry',\" said Van Rensburg, a now retired station commander who was the first policeman to arrive at Pistorius's home after he shot Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year.\n\nThe admission came as Van Rensburg was answering questions from prosecutor Gerrie Nel on day ten of the murder trial, testifying notably that there was no sign of forced entry into the disabled track star's home.\n\nPistorius contends that he shot Steenkamp through a locked door in the belief that there was an intruder hiding behind it, and has pleaded not guilty to premeditated murder.\n\nIn cross-examination, Pistorius's lawyer wasted no time in probing for further errors in the police investigation, and accused Van Rensburg of tailoring his evidence to keep former policeman Hilton Botha off the witness stand.\n\nBotha became a household name when he admitted during Pistorius's bail hearing last year that he failed to wear protective footwear when inspecting the scene of the shooting.\n\nHe was promptly pulled off the high-profile case and subsequently resigned.\n\n\"You allowed yourself to give evidence that was designed to take the place of Mr Botha... You are standing in for Mr Botha's evidence on aspects that you cannot stand in for,\" Barry Roux, for Pistorius, said.\n\nVan Rensburg denied this, adding that Botha had told him that he expected to be called to testify in the trial.\n\nBefore he launched into cross-examination, Roux had asked whether the State planned to call Botha, to which Nel responded: \"I don't know yet, My Lady. We'll decide that as the evidence comes.\"\n\nThe defence lawyer proceeded to charge that Van Rensburg's initial statement was silent on \"material facts\", implying that in his responses he was relying on observations that were in fact made by Botha.\n\nSlowly taking Van Rensburg through the police's actions in the hours and days that followed Steenkamp's shooting, he repeated like a refrain: \"Where was Mr Botha?\"\n\nVan Rensburg testified that Botha was with him when they followed a trial of blood leading up the stairs of Pistorius's home, but said he did not see his colleague touch or move anything.\n\nAsked why his statement failed to mention Botha's presence at the time, he said that in police statements \"I\" can sometimes mean \"we\".\n\nRoux asked whether the court could rely on police photographs taken at Pistorius's home as true reflections of the state in which investigators had found the scene.\n\n\"When can we rely on the scene photo as a true reflection, and when is it changed?\" he said, indicating a picture showing a cell phone lying next to a grey towel on the bathroom floor.\n\nVan Rensburg was forced to concede that initially the towel had covered the phone and said in police investigations only the first photographs should be understood to show a scene unchanged, since more were taken as police continued their work.\n\nRoux pointed out that Van Rensburg had in projections shown to him in court failed to notice the difference between sets of photographs of the same scene -- including the altered position of a pair of white flip-flops -- and asked the witness: \"How do you feel about your ability to observe?\"\n\nIt was above average, the former station commander replied modestly after a difficult morning.\n\nHe told the court he erected security barriers around Pistorius's home the scene of the shooting after an expensive watch belonging to the accused mysteriously disappeared.\n\n\"I didn't trust anyone at that stage,\" he said.\n\nVan Rensburg said when he arrived at the house, he found Steenkamp's body under bloodied coverings. Pistorius was pacing the kitchen floor and was too distraught to respond when asked what had happened.\n\n\"My deduction was that as a result of his emotional state, he was not able to answer.\"\n\nThe State did not re-examine Van Rensburg and Judge Thokozile Masipa adjourned the trial until Monday morning.\n\nThe trial is expected to continue until April 4.",

          "fulltext": u"Oscar Pistorius contends that he shot Steenkamp through a locked door in the belief that there was an intruder hiding behind it. (AFP)\n\nA former police officer testifying in the Oscar Pistorius murder trial admitted on Friday evidence was mishandled on the scene where the Paralympian shot Reeva Steenkamp.\n\nGiliam van Rensburg told the high court in Pretoria he was dismayed to see a colleague pick up the handgun found on Pistorius's bloodied bathroom floor without protective gloves.\n\n\"So I asked him what are you doing?\" said Van Rensburg, adding that at this the ballistics expert looked down and realised he was bare-handed. \"And then he said 'sorry',\" said Van Rensburg, a now retired station commander, who was the first policeman to arrive at Pistorius's home after he shot Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year.\n\nThe admission came as Van Rensburg was answering questions from prosecutor Gerrie Nel on day 10 of the murder trial, testifying notably that there was no sign of forced entry into the disabled track star's home.\n\nPistorius contends that he shot Steenkamp through a locked door in the belief that there was an intruder hiding behind it, and has pleaded not guilty to premeditated murder.\n\nIn cross-examination, Pistorius's lawyer wasted no time in probing for further errors in the police investigation, and accused Van Rensburg of tailoring his evidence to keep former policeman Hilton Botha off the witness stand.\n\nResignation\n\nBotha admitted during Pistorius's bail hearing last year that he failed to wear protective footwear when inspecting the scene of the shooting. He was promptly pulled off the high-profile case and subsequently resigned.\n\n\"You allowed yourself to give evidence that was designed to take the place of Mr Botha ... You are standing in for Mr Botha's evidence on aspects that you cannot stand in for,\" Barry Roux, for Pistorius, said.\n\nVan Rensburg denied this, adding that Botha had told him that he expected to be called to testify in the trial.\n\nBefore he launched into cross-examination, Roux had asked whether the state planned to call Botha, to which Nel responded: \"I don't know yet, My Lady. We'll decide that as the evidence comes.\"\n\nThe defence lawyer proceeded to charge that Van Rensburg's initial statement was silent on \"material facts\", implying that in his responses he was relying on observations that were in fact made by Botha.\n\nSlowly taking Van Rensburg through the police's actions in the hours and days that followed Steenkamp's shooting, he repeated like a refrain: \"Where was Mr Botha?\"\n\nVan Rensburg testified that Botha was with him when they followed a trial of blood leading up the stairs of Pistorius's home, but said he did not see his colleague touch or move anything. Asked why his statement failed to mention Botha's presence at the time, he said that in police statements \"I\" can sometimes mean \"we\".\n\nTrue reflection\n\n Roux asked whether the court could rely on police photographs taken at Pistorius's home as true reflections of the state in which investigators had found the scene. \"When can we rely on the scene photo as a true reflection, and when is it changed?\" he said, indicating a picture showing a cell phone lying next to a grey towel on the bathroom floor.\n\nVan Rensburg was forced to concede that initially the towel had covered the phone and said in police investigations only the first photographs should be understood to show a scene unchanged, since more were taken as police continued their work.\n\nRoux pointed out that Van Rensburg had in projections shown to him in court failed to notice the difference between sets of photographs of the same scene - including the altered position of a pair of white flip-flops - and asked the witness: \"How do you feel about your ability to observe?\"\n\nIt was above average, the former station commander replied modestly after a difficult morning.\n\nHe told the court he erected security barriers around Pistorius's home the scene of the shooting after an expensive watch belonging to the accused mysteriously disappeared. \"I didn't trust anyone at that stage,\" he said.\n\nVan Rensburg said when he arrived at the house, he found Steenkamp's body under bloodied coverings. Pistorius was pacing the kitchen floor and was too distraught to respond when asked what had happened.\n\n\"My deduction was that as a result of his emotional state, he was not able to answer.\"\n\nThe state did not re-examine Van Rensburg and Judge Thokozile Masipa adjourned the trial until Monday morning.\n\nThe trial is expected to continue until April 4. - Sapa",

          "fulltext": u"Pretoria - Paralympian Oscar Pistorius has received support from his family and friends during his murder trial because he is a kind and generous person, a friend from Iceland said.\n\n\n\nEbba Gudny Gudmundstottir and her mother flew from Iceland to Pretoria to support the athlete and his family as he faces murder charges after he shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in February last year.\n\n\n\n\"He is a very kind person, he is a good human being and you always feel safe and comfortable when you are around him,\" an emotional Gudmundstottir told Sapa.\n\n\n\n\"He takes care of his friends and he is there for them. He is very generous with his time and with his love and empathy.\n\n\n\n\"Oscar is just very special. That's why it is very difficult to understand what is going on here now.\"\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir sat in the back row of the public gallery in the North Gauteng High Court from 3-13 March.\n\n\n\n‘Just like Pistorius'\n\n\n\nShe cried in court on Monday, when pathologist Professor Gert Saayman described Steenkamp's wounds. Pistorius himself was emotional and was retching in the dock as Saayman spoke.\n\n\n\nSaayman said Steenkamp died as a result of multiple gun shots.\n\n\n\nPistorius is on trial for the murder of Steenkamp who was shot through a locked bathroom door of his Pretoria home on 14 February last year. He said he had mistaken her for an intruder.\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir said it was important to show physical support for the 27-year-old athlete who had been her friend for almost nine years.\n\n\n\n\"He was always there for us when we needed comfort. It is no tragedy to have a child who has no legs but there are difficult moments,\" she said emotionally.\n\n\n\n\"He was always there for us, so that's why we want to be here now when he needs friends. We wanted to give him physical support because that's what he gave to us.\"\n\n\n\nHer eight-year-old son Halli was \"just like Pistorius\" and he was born with missing fibulae bones, she said. Both his legs were amputated when he was 11 months old.\n\n\n\nBorn without fibulae, Pistorius had both his lower legs amputated before he was a year old.\n\n\n\nHe was the poster-boy of ambition and overcame adversity, becoming the first amputee to compete on the track in the able-bodied Olympics in 2012.\n\n\n\nHeartfelt gratitude\n\n\n\nAn emotional Gudmundstottir remembered how she befriended Pistorius.\n\n\n\nDoctors told Gudmundstottir when she was 20 weeks pregnant with her son that he would be born with no legs.\n\n\n\nShe remembered how worried, scared and confused she was because there was no record of a child being born like that in Iceland.\n\n\n\nShe said then they googled \"double-amputee\" and found a photograph of Pistorius running in the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens.\n\n\n\n\"I can't explain how happy I was [when I found the photograph] because I did not know what it meant when they told me my son did not have legs,\" Gudmundstottir recalled.\n\n\n\n\"I just really did not understand it. I did not know anybody with no legs so seeing this was like a miracle to me.\"\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir said her mother, who was also in court to support Pistorius, contacted a journalist who interviewed the athlete and asked him to convey the family's heartfelt gratitude for having been there \"without knowing it\".\n\n\n\nHer face lit up as she remembered the reply from Pistorius.\n\n\n\n\"He wrote my mom back and said 'hi I'm Oscar Pistorius, were you looking for me' with a smiley face,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"Then he said if there is anything I can help you with, just let me know.\"\n\n\n\nPatriotic\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir said they started corresponding and a year later he went to Iceland because of his blades and asked to meet the family.\n\n\n\nThe Gudmundstottir's invited him to their home and said as a family they had peace of mind after seeing Pistorius and seeing what he had accomplished.\n\n\n\n\"Oscar was extremely polite, and kind. He told jokes, he was just very kind to both my children. It was very obvious what kind of a person he is,\" she said.\n\n\n\nPistorius and the Gudmundstottirs became close and the family went to Manchester, in London, to see him run.\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir remembered one athletics meet when Pistorius won a gold medal and they were on a hill nearby.\n\n\n\n\"Oscar came running to us and he put his gold medal around my son's neck and he said to him 'this is for you champion' and my son was just beaming with joy,\" she recalled with tears in her yes.\n\n\n\nPistorius also showed Halli, who was three at the time, that they were the same which made the toddler beam with joy, she said.\n\n\n\n\"Halli was happy because in Iceland he is always the only one who doesn't have any legs, so it was a lovely thing to do,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"Oscar means a lot to us and we know him well.\"\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir said the athlete was patriotic and showed them pictures of South Africa.\n\n\n\n\"He loves his country, he loves the people, he loves the food and is always bragging about it,\" she said.\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir said she would continue to support her friend despite returning to Iceland on Thursday. He mother would stay another week.\n\n",

          "fulltext": u"This emerged in Pistorius's murder trail in the High Court in Pretoria where former Boschkop police station commander Giliam van Rensburg faced his first round of cross-examination by Barry Roux, SC, for Pistorius.\n\nHe said when he went into Pistorius's bedroom he saw the curtains were open and he moved a silver fan to get on to the balcony.\n\nHe and Warrant Officer Hilton Botha had followed a trail of blood up the stairs and into the bedroom.\n\nVan Rensburg and Botha have since resigned from the SA Police Service.\n\nBotha was replaced as investigating officer as questions were raised over his handling of the investigation.\n\nVan Rensburg is now a sports coach after he resigned in December.\n\nThe positioning of the fan and the curtains may form part of cross-examination to corroborate Pistorius's version that he moved it inside from the balcony before the shooting.\n\nPistorius said during his bail application he feared there might be an intruder in the bathroom when he heard a noise in the early hours of February 14, 2013.\n\nWorkmen had been over and he had seen a ladder against the wall previously, Pistorius said at the bail application.\n\nPistorius said he shot through the toilet door in the bathroom, and later realised he had killed Steenkamp.\n\nShe had been spending the night.\n\nHe bashed at the door with a cricket bat to free her and took her downstairs where she died.\n\nVan Rensburg said earlier he had arrived at Pistorius's home at 3.45am after coming from an armed robbery elsewhere.\n\nHe said he found Pistorius \"very emotional\" and crying, but not unstable.\n\nHe tried to ask him twice what happened but he did not talk to Van Rensburg.\n\nPistorius obeyed an instruction to move to the back of the kitchen where he had been standing.\n\nHe and Botha followed a trail of blood up the steps and into the bedroom and bathroom.\n\nHe went towards the balcony from the right side of the room because the blood trails went to the left.\n\nHe said he also did not see a baseball bat at the entrance to the room at first, next to the air rifle and the sunglasses cabinet.\n\nHe saw it later. He explained that as the first on a crime scene an officer sees things but is also assisting a team.\n\n\"So you discover things later,\" he said.\n\nThese are added to later reports.\n\nVan Rensburg said that looking over the bedroom balcony on the morning of the shooting he did see ladders outside.\n\nBut he insisted there was no window in the toilet cubicle, just the bathroom windows.\n\nBut Roux insisted there was.\n\nPistorius has pleaded not guilty to murder, which the State alleges was premeditated and could have been during an argument.\n\nPistorius is also charged with contraventions of the Firearms Control Act.\n\nHe allegedly fired a shot from a Glock pistol under a table at a Johannesburg restaurant in January 2013.\n\nOn September 30, 2012 he allegedly fired a shot from his 9mm pistol through the open sunroof of a car while driving with friends in Modderfontein.",

          "fulltext": u"Too much: Oscar Pistorius gesture during a hearing of his murder trial at the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria yesterday. Picture: AFP\n\nMichael Appel\n\n\n\n If we in the media are feeling fatigued by now, one wouldn't even want to venture a guess how murder accused Oscar Pistorius is feeling as the second week of his trial winds to a close today.\n\n\n\n Without a doubt, it's been a tough week for the Paralympian, emotionally in particular.\n\n\n\n He's had his friends take the stand to talk the world through what was intimate moments among pals and he's been painted as a cocky, arrogant, responsibility-dodging hothead by telling testimony from friend, or former friend, Darren Fresco.\n\n\n\n Fresco gave insight into what transpired in his car on the day in September 2012 when Pistorius allegedly fired off a round through his sunroof “without warning”.\n\n\n\n Fresco, also involved in the Tasha restaurant's accidental shooting incident in January last year, gave his version of events that led to the athlete discharging his firearm in the busy restaurant.\n\n\n\n His version of events, what pro boxer Kevin Lerena attested to happened in Tasha's and Pistorius's version of events all differ.\n\n\n\n Interesting how three different versions of the same event have so far been offered to the court.\n\n\n\n Regardless of the strength of Fresco's evidence as a state witness, many will argue that his testimony achieved what it set out to do - taint the wholesome role-model image of the Blade Runner.\n\n\n\n What perhaps stands out most as the second week of his trial comes to an end, is the world's fascination with the Paralympian's reaction to the graphic post-mortem testimony led in court.\n\n\n\n Pathologist Prof Gert Saayman spared no detail in describing, very clinically, the gunshot wounds sustained by law graduate and model Reeva Steenkamp.\n\n\n\n We know that the bullets that were used were Black Talon hollow points, designed to cause “maximum tissue damage”.\n\n\n\n Significantly, Saayman made mention of the fact that “it would be abnormal for someone not to scream”, even after being shot in the head.\n\n\n\n This from an experienced and respected pathologist strongly casts doubt on the defence's version that Steenkamp would not have been able to scream due to the incapacitating head wound.\n\n\n\n On Tuesday, the fatality of her wounds was described to the court resulting in a cacophony of what media houses labelled “retching noises” coming from the visibly distraught athlete.\n\n\n\n The entrance of social media platform Twitter into everyday journalism has given every hack the ability to bring their followers into the court room with them.\n\n\n\n Every gesture Pistorius makes, every smile, every frown, every head-in-hands moment is broadcast almost simultaneously to cell phones, tablets and computers around the world.\n\n\n\n Retired Col Schoombie van Rensburg, the former station commander at Boschkop police station, yesterday painstakingly walked the court through his every footstep as blood splatter after blood splatter photo of his trail through the house was presented to the court.\n\n\n\n The defence is expected to come out strongly on just how so much blood splatter ended up on what many would consider unlikely places in the home.\n\n\n\n There was blood splatter on a pillar downstairs, his duvet, the stairway walls, in the bath, in the basin and even on a small cabinet containing eight of Pistorius's wristwatches in his bedroom.\n\n\n\n Before week three even gets under way on Monday, the National Prosecuting Authority has said that the case is likely to drag on well into April.\n\n\n\n If you're already suffering from overexposure to the constant stream of news coming from the trial, settle down, it may be a long one.\n\n\n\n michaela@thenewage.co.za\n\n",

          "fulltext": u"CAPE TOWN - The Oscar Pistorius trial has garnered international interest, generating vast hits on countless websites across the world and taking social media by storm.\n\nTwo weeks into the case and the interest shows no signs of waning. Where there's web-based interest, the memes are sure to follow, with hundreds of Pistorius-related memes being generated and shared across platforms.\n\nThe most memed player in the Pistorius drama to date has been defence advocate Barry Roux, with his bulldog style and particular way of speaking.\n\nRoux's most repeated phrases have found their way not only onto shareable memes, but also into Twitter and Facebook streams. “I put it to you” has become a commonplace term on social media in a matter of days. It's a phenomenon Stephen Grootes explores in The Considered View.\n\nA particular favourite for meme fodder is the testimony that has been led concerning the bathroom door through which Pistorius shot his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. This week has seen extensive testimony regarding the marks on the door and how they might have come to be there.\n\nMemes aren't the only place that the trial is being spoofed - an Instagram account called LegoPistorius is also gaining traction. The creators use Lego figures to recreate courtroom scenes. \n\n\n\n Then there's the parody Barry Roux Twitter account (@BarryRouxLaw), which already has thousands of followers.\n\n\n\n There are also apps and threads springing up in response to the drama in the courtroom.\n\nOthers have sought to capitalise on the viral nature of the trial and came up short. A Cape Town bakery published pictures of its colourful cookies, depicting the athlete with slogans like \"he did it\" and \"Oscar goes to jail\".\n\nAfter intense criticism on social media, the business apologised, saying their meme had been a huge error in judgment.",

          "fulltext": u"Both Gert Saayman and Johan Vermeulen are applied scientists. Both hold a number of formal qualifications that saw them trained in forensic investigations. Both have plied their respective trades for decades. Both have much experience in acting as expert witnesses in criminal trials, and explaining their sometimes complex findings to courts.\n\nBut in the second week of the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp, forensic pathologist Saayman and ­materials analyst Vermeulen had very ­different experiences in the witness box, vividly illustrating both the advantages and the pitfalls of matching the scientific method to a system of adversarial justice.\n\nAll indications are that judgment in the Pistorius murder trial - a case that prosecutor Gerrie Nel himself described as circumstantial - will hinge on various branches of forensic science, from ballistics to pathology.\n\nThere is every reason to believe the findings drawn from the science will be highly contested; Pistorius's defence team has lined up experts to counter witnesses called by the state.\n\nDefence lead advocate Barry Roux SC did not wait to call his own witnesses to begin the legal assault on the state's version of events on the night Steenkamp died.\n\nUnusual strategy\n\n Continuing an unusual strategy implemented during bail proceedings a year ago, when Pistorius submitted a highly detailed account of the night, the defence team made no secret of the sequence of events it will present to the court - a sequence it will argue shows Pistorius did not commit murder.\n\nIt was an approach that saw Vermeulen mauled by Roux during cross-examination, pushed to participate in sometimes bizarre ­physical demonstrations of the cricket bat and door he had been tasked with examining, and forced into joining ever more complicated speculation about plausible and implausible sequences of events.\n\nSaayman, by contrast, had an easier time under cross-examination earlier in the week, with most of his findings and many of his conclusions from Steenkamp's autopsy accepted as presented.\n\nThe difference seemed rooted in a difference of approach.\n\nThe meticulous Saayman described a process that differentiated between observation and interpretation, providing a few hypotheses gingerly, with many caveats. He presented work almost entirely free of assumptions - but also of hard, testable findings.\n\nTwo approaches\n\n Whereas Saayman laid out measurements and then spoke in terms of probabilities, Vermeulen provided what he considered likely scenarios, then explained why he had reached the conclusions he had. Saayman's language was peppered with precise medical terms impenetrable to the lay person and requiring less precise explanation; Vermeulen used vaguely defined words and phrases imprecise enough to make an academic cringe.\n\nYet the decidedly more blue-collar approach to finding the truth taken by police employee Vermeulen may be preferable to Saayman's more scientifically pure approach in a court.\n\n\"You want information put to you, but you also want to have a version that silks [senior advocates] can bash around [to] see if it stands up,\" explained a court officer not involved in the matter. \"If a guy is saying, 'this is what I think happened', that is a witness we can evaluate. If a guy says, 'here is what I measured', it can lack meaning.\"\n\nBut had each been defending a thesis outside a court, or been subjected to peer review of a paper, Saayman would have succeeded where Vermeulen would fail.\n\nBoth men presented evidence not in keeping with the version of events Pistorius described on the night of Valentine's Day 2013, before and after he shot Steenkamp. Pistorius said the couple had turned in for the night hours before midnight; Saayman said Steenkamp might have eaten something several hours later. Pistorius said he was wearing his prosthetic legs when he broke down a door to reach Steenkamp; Vermeulen said it appeared that Pistorius was so low to the ground at the time that he must have been standing on his stumps.\n\nWorlds apart\n\n The manner in which they presented their findings was worlds apart. Saayman delivered what was, in effect, a mini-lecture to explain the caveats that went with his finding of when Steenkamp had had her last meal.\n\nHe noted that this problem had been closely studied because it is both important in investigating murders particularly fraught with difficulty.\n\nHe described the imprecision of the science involved. He cited the possibility of very large meals, or very small meals, affecting the time taken to digest food.\n\nHe cautioned that different types of food are digested at different speeds, that different people digest food at different speeds, and that the same person could digest food at different rates from one day to the next.\n\nHe explained that food continued to be digested after death. Only then would he allow that the probable time between meal and death was, probably, approximately, two hours.\n\nNo prosthetics\n\n Vermeulen, on the other hand, presented his theory that Pistorius was not wearing prosthetics when he broke down the toilet door in what Roux would later refer to as an \"ambush\" (the finding was not contained in the written report Vermeulen had compiled).\n\nVermeulen then found himself defending that theory from a furious attack by the defence counsel, at one point being made to balance on his knees but with his feet in the air - trying to swing a cricket bat. Roux pushed hard: What constitutes an \"unnatural\" position in which to swing a cricket bat? How many ­positions were actually tested?\n\nIf the police stood in service of the accused as much as the prosecution, as Vermeulen said, why was a version of events presented by Pistorius not tested under laboratory conditions?\n\nVermeulen, at times with a bemused expression, found his hypothesis gradually eroded through small concessions and new caveats.\n\nTo lay watchers, it appeared that Vermeulen was demolished by the defence, while Saayman held his ground.\n\nBasic principles\n\n To scientists working in the rarefied air of academia, it appeared that Vermeulen had ignored basic principles; Saayman stuck to them.\n\nTo police with a job to do, one officer commented, it seemed that Saayman lacked the guts to point the finger of accusation, whereas Vermeulen did his job.\n\nTo some judicial officers, it seemed Vermeulen provided a testable version of events, even if it were found wanting, but Saayman's approach left the court to interpret his data with too little guidance.\n\nAll of which is, of course, irrelevant, and how Judge Thokozile Masipa interpreted the evidence of each expert will only be clear when she provides a summary of evidence before delivering the verdict.\n\nIf theory holds and the history of complex cases is any guide, the court will not see any individual witness or single piece of evidence as either bolstering or undermining Pistorius's version of events, nor will it point to a smoking gun proving whether or not a murder was committed.\n\nInstead, it will consider all the information before it: as pieces of a puzzle to be weighed and tested against one another - measured for import and plausibility, and carefully fitted into the whole.\n\nCounsel for the state and defence in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius on Thursday said they had agreed to continue his trial for an additional two weeks before planning further dates.\n\nThe new dates had not been ratified by the court at the time of publication, but that was considered a formality.\n\nThe case was due to be heard between March 3 and March 20, but halfway through that period it was evident that far more time would be required - with prosecutors still painstakingly building a case and state witnesses subjected to lengthy cross-examination.\n\nThe trial is now expected to continue without interruption until April 4, with an assessment to be done towards the middle of April on how much further court time will be required and to agree on dates. - Phillip de Wet",

      "fulltext": u"In two new studies, engineers have used simulations in an attempt to understand how the wingless reptile, from the genus Chrysopelea, manages to remain airborne reported The Columbian.\n\nAccording to The Guardian the snakes are found in the lowland rainforests of south-east and south Asia. Flying snakes (which actually glide rather than fly) are fairly small creatures, growing to lengths of just over a metre and about the diameter of a lipstick. But jumping from a tall tree they can reach a horizontal distance of 10 times their body length.\n\nWhile in the air, the snakes transform their shape, splaying their ribs and flattening their bodies. Through computational and physical modelling researchers have discovered that this adapted shape allows them to increase their aerodynamics whilst creating whirlwinds of air above their bodies to suck them upwards.\n\n“Little by little, we built a theory about how the snakes are interacting with the air to generate very large lift forces,” said aeronautical engineer Lorena Barba of George Washington University. Barba authored a study published in Physics of Fluids called The Lift and Wakes of Flying Snakes.\n\nTreehugger reported that researchers are trying to understand how the snakes fly in order to solve mechanical problems in the real world. The team used computational fluid dynamics to study the aerodynamics of the snakes.\n\n\"It's not wild to think that our understanding of the fluid mechanics of this particular shape could lead us to, for example, design a different type of air flow that is ideal for energy harvesting, or a wind turbine - or who knows,” said Barba. \"You find applications in unexpected places.\"\n\n“We hope to learn the solutions that nature has found for flight at small scales- insects, birds and animal gliders are all quite small compared to aeroplanes,” said Barba.",

      "fulltext": u"Trevor Manuel\n\n\n\n It has been an incredibly rich experience to have worked with the members of the Parliament that are here today and those that have been here before. It may be a naive view but I have the sense that we are bound together by the same oath of allegiance to the Constitution. We may come to issues slightly differently but we are all here to serve our country and the people who have elected us.\n\n\n\n One of the high points of my long tenure must be the first time I was sworn in as a member of Parliament. I had the great privilege to be part of the first group of 10 to be sworn in as members of Parliament in a democratic South Africa on May 9, 1994. I stood in this house alongside Frene Ginwala, Jay Naidoo, Albertina Sisulu, Joe Slovo, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, Cyril Ramaphosa, Thabo Mbeki and, of course, Nelson Mandela.\n\n\n\n While the incredible significance of that day for the nation cannot be adequately expressed in words even now, as a personal memory, it is one that I am sure will stay with me to the end of my days. The sentiment at the time was best expressed by our newly elected first president when he addressed a gathering at the Grand Parade on May 9 that year and said: “Today we are entering a new era for our country and its people. Today we celebrate not the victory of a party, but a victory for all the people of SA.”\n\n\n\n This was a profound moment of joy for me, having been granted the opportunity to be part of building the country for which I had fought for so long.\n\n\n\n For me, the election this year brings to a conclusion 20 years of continuing service as a public representative. Firstly, as a member of this august chamber and it bears saying that I still consider service in this house a privilege that we sometimes take too lightly. And secondly, the ability to have served as a member of the Cabinet for two decades is an even rarer privilege.\n\n\n\n I have had the privilege of being asked to serve by four successive presidents. This is a privilege that I share with my Cabinet colleagues such as Jeff Radebe. I want to express my gratitude through one of those presidents, Kgalema Motlanthe, present here today.\n\n\n\n Twenty years has been a journey of discovery and learning, of getting to know myself, my colleagues and comrades, understanding our country and the world. There were discoveries of the many possibilities and of where the boundaries were and of how to push back those boundaries. Through all of those experiences I leave here wiser and richer.\n\n\n\n Taking leave after 20 years puts me in the privileged position of having many special memories at this institution. The memories of those early days of robustness of debate, of the political sparring that took place between the members on either side of this chamber, of the level of preparedness by all MPs from parties when standing up here as I do today.\n\n\n\n It brings me back to a theme that I have repeated often in my time here; do we really use this chamber adequately to debate and understand topical issues impacting on the lives of those that we represent? Issues such the effect of the 2008 crisis and the consequent effect on economies across the globe should have been addressed in this house as an ongoing issue. I watched the portfolio committee on trade and industry have interesting hearings and discussions on the impact of unsecured lending on the lives of the poor and I have to wonder why it was not addressed in the same manner in the house first.\n\n\n\n When we observe the horror of an unfolding pogrom in the Central African Republic it raises two points. It should remind us that we did not pay sufficient attention to the Rwandese genocide because we were too busy securing our own freedom at the time. It should, more than ever, express the importance of addressing these matters directly instead of using issues in the house as a bouncing ball to score points. We should consider it our role and responsibility as African and South Africans.\n\n\n\n A lesson from those initial years was when president Mandela appointed me as the leader of government business of an institution that I did not know. This was at the time that I was the minister for Trade and Industry which required extensive travel outside of the country. I think that the honourable Koos van der Merwe must be one of the few remaining whips from that period who must have wondered about the sanity of Madiba's choice at the time. This was a learning experience about taking on responsibilities that could not be fulfilled.\n\n\n\n Even as we jettison the notion of rationality as we tend to do in an election, we must remember that we have a responsibility to maintain the hope of our people in democracy and its ability to better their lives. Giving effect to that responsibility happens here in this house.\n\n\n\n It would be remiss of me if I did not express my sincere appreciation to the leadership of the ANC who saw fit to trust me with the responsibilities of a member of the executive. For this I thank President Jacob Zuma, deputy and former president Kgalema Motlanthe and former president Thabo Mbeki. My greatest honour, however, has been the incredible faith and confidence that Nelson Mandela had in my abilities and I hope that I was able to meet his expectations. My conduct and actions were, and remain, guided by his words and his example. I must thank the ANC for the opportunity to serve and flourish and assisted me to live out the values and the policies that the movement has always represented to me and to the people of the country.",

      "fulltext": u"Kgalema Motlanthe\n\n\n\n I sincerely thank you for this farewell tribute to me today. It is truly humbling to have time set aside for oneself for a farewell tribute by as august a house as the National Assembly of our republic.\n\n\n\n Mr Speaker, at times life seems inscrutably hard to make sense of precisely because one has to study life while still living it. I wonder whether Charles Lindbergh was moved by the self-same realisation when he memorably remarked that “Life is like a landscape. You live in the midst of it but can describe it only from the vantage point of distance”.\n\n\n\n Forgive me up-front, therefore, that since I am still a serving member, albeit for a few days more, I may not be able to lift myself from the spatio-temporal limitations imposed by my formal presence in this house so that I share a retrospective account that may appeal to your sense of history. After six years of history I am running the whole gamut of human emotions from melancholy to elation. Humanity is conditioned to experience emotions attuned to the peculiarities of the moment.\n\n\n\n Yet for me right now this is a moment laden with mixed emotions. For one thing I am disconsolate for parting ways with members of the party I come from, the African National Congress (ANC). You will know that my presence in this house is attributable to the ANC, which has, for all this time, been my extended family.\n\n\n\n On the ticket of the ANC I took oath of office, both as minister in the presidency and subsequently the president of our country. Both these occasions were of historical moment in various ways.\n\n\n\n As the minister I assumed office intent on serving our nation in keeping with the philosophical tenets of the ANC. At the same time, as the president of our republic, I took office under anomalous circumstances.\n\n\n\n This was the time during which our nation, for the first time since the onset of democracy, faced its sternest test. Eight months before the end of the third term of office (of the democratic state) for the sitting president, honourable Thabo Mbeki, destiny commandeered me to assume the reigns of the presidency to see the term through.\n\n\n\n As the world turned, many were beginning to wonder whether this conjuncture signalled the beginning of the end for our nation. Unprecedented, it was a defining moment. This house knows, as do many of us, that there is a standing assumption that our nation is no exception to the sad experience that has befallen many a post-colonial country, not least our continent, Africa.\n\n\n\n No sooner had we disarmed Afro-pessimists with a smooth transition to democracy than this difficult historical period emerged, seen in some quarters as sounding a death knell to our nation. Those less given to hyperbole saw our country as being on the cusp of a new era, the contours of which, though, were as yet indistinct.\n\n\n\n In the event, we proved the doomsayers wrong. But I am losing my bearing. The story does not begin here.\n\n\n\n Into these murky conditions of uncertainty thrown up by the unrelenting hand of contingency I was plunged. As it turned out I was, in this epochal task, guided, supported, assisted and encouraged by the ANC.\n\n\n\n Instinctually I would affirm that whatever I managed to help our nation do correctly during those trying times, I did so leaning on the ANC as my pillar of strength. For this, I am eternally grateful.\n\n\n\n Our system of democracy is ultimately about creating a multi-vocal society, thriving on irreconcilable ideological differences, none of which, paradoxically, can survive without the other.\n\n\n\n It is a political ecology which, while rife with discordant voices and atonal noises on the surface, needs every voice for the survival of all, at least at an imperceptible level.\n\n\n\n Being asked to serve one's country at any point in history is always an honour. However, the truth is our nation is replete with luminous talent. Not only that, at some point serving leadership must give way so that new blood, fired up with life-changing ideas, can take society to a higher level of development. Necessarily, the time comes when all “leaders”, as HG Wells advises, “should lead as far as they can and then vanish. Their ashes should not choke the fire they have lit.”\n\n\n\n I would not let my ashes choke the verdant future that is beginning to assume some discernible outlines on the horizon. Few have been the moments in human history when the time was ever right for a leader to leave.\n\n\n\n On another level, I am happy to have played the small part history has assigned me. I leave office over the moon that the ANC and by extension the people of our country, have entrusted me with the responsibility to help steer our nation to the future.\n\n\n\n Mr Speaker, I have come to the conclusion that as this house moves into the fifth term of office, we will need to come to terms with the imperatives of our age. We need to service a large vision bigger than the clutter of the age.\n\n\n\n Right now South Africa does not need homo politicus (man the politician) but, in a classical sense, homo creans (man the creator); bold visionaries whose sights transcend the frontiers of time. The imperatives of our time enjoin this august house to rise above beguiling but small-minded discourse adorned with rhetorical embroidery to think realistically about the future of our nation.zWe have a duty to this nation and a responsibility to posterity. That responsibility has just begun.\n\n\n\n We have to do this bearing in mind Francois Chateaubriand's assertion that “Every revolution is the consequence of one revolution and the beginning of another.”\n\n\n\n We are in the middle of another revolution. We dare not sell out.",

Picture: IHSAAN HAFFEJEE\n\nQaanitah Hunter\n\n\n\n A universal benchmark of leadership stands in the formidable shadow of the first democratic president of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.\n\n\n\n And the once Robben Island inmate acknowledged the crucial role public servants have in doing just that - serving the public.\n\n\n\n On the 100-day anniversary of a democratic parliament, Mandela reaffirmed that public servants need loyalty and a preparedness to change.\n\n\n\n “The second crucial question pertains to the task of ensuring that the public service becomes a servant of the public in fact,” the world icon told the then sitting of the National Assembly. Now as the fifth democratic elections creeps closer, the edgy topic of public servants fit to govern surfaces once again.\n\n\n\n This week political parties had to submit a list of names to serve in the National Assembly and provincial legislatures.\n\n\n\n “Parliament plays a direct and active role in national affairs. It is the place where the members of Parliament look after your interests,” Parliament's website says.\n\n\n\n But, we argue, are even half the individuals that make it to parliament even fit to lead the country?\n\n\n\n Different political parties use various methods in selecting their candidates.\n\n\n\n The ANC says it uses a bottom-up approach in its selection.\n\n\n\n “The branches nominate individuals and that is how they appear on the list,” ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said.\n\n\n\n The DA says it boasts an electoral college where candidates apply and are subjected to a vigorous testing mechanism.\n\n\n\n Political analyst Prof Steven Friedman said all political parties misrepresented their process of selection of candidates.\n\n\n\n On the ANC, he said while branches suggest names of candidates, it is a group of national leaders that make the final decision\n\n\n\n “National leaders are passing the buck. They must take responsibility for the list,” Friedman said.\n\n\n\n He further criticised the DA's approach to selection of candidates.\n\n\n\n “The DA selects candidates like they are choosing someone for a job,” Friedman said.\n\n\n\n He said the elite leadership of parties make the decision so as to who should lead and where.\n\n\n\n He further said political loyalty played an imperative part in the selection of candidates.\n\n\n\n This was an issue brought up in light of several “shady characters” being on the ANC's lists.\n\n\n\n ANC national executive committee member Pule Mabe made it to number 53 despite being arrested on charges of theft, fraud and money laundering for allegedly being part of an attempt to defraud the South African Social Security Agency.\n\n\n\n Another ANC candidate for the national assembly, Andile Lungisa who is standing trial in the Johannesburg Commercial Crimes Court on a charge of corruption.\n\n\n\n Dina Pule, the disgraced former communications minister is also set to return despite being found guilty of lying to parliament.\n\n\n\n Friedman said the ANC's decision to chose candidates who are facing criminal charges will do the party a disservice.\n\n\n\n “Obviously the ordinary card carrying member of the ANC will be dissatisfied with these people going to parliament,” he said.\n\n\n\n But Prof Susan Booysen believes the candidates on the political parties does not affect the way the electorate votes.\n\n\n\n “I think the lists have no direct bearing on how people vote,” she said.\n\n\n\n Analyst Somadoda Fikeni seemed to disagree with Booysen.\n\n\n\n “Political parties, especially the smaller ones, use their candidates to get credibility in the eyes of the average voter,” he said.\n\n\n\n The most ostensible name on the DA's candidate list is former National Prosecuting Authority prosecutor Glynnis Breytenbach.\n\n\n\n She is leaving her role as a prosecutor to serve in the National Assembly.\n\n\n\n Breytenbach is perceived by many as a fearless prosecutor despite the internal challenges she faced within the NPA.\n\n\n\n Agang SA has renowned forensic investigator Paul O'Sullivan on its list of candidates.\n\n\n\n O'Sullivan is famous for his role in the prosecution of former police chief Jackie Selebi.\n\n\n\n Fikeni said parties like the DA were reliant on the credibility of individuals.\n\n\n\n “The list process is a prisoner of people who have constituencies- real and perceived- no matter what they have done wrong or right,” he said.\n\n\n\n However, he said things are a little different for the ANC, saying the party would “survive” despite weaker or compromised candidates.\n\n\n\n “This is because they have general brand and liberation narrative that transcends individuals,” Fikeni said.\n\n\n\n All political analysts concur that political loyalty trumps fitness to lead in every political party.\n\n\n\n But the onus is on political parties to school their leaders in governance in an effort to win the confidence of the electorate.\n\n\n\n qaanitahh@thenewage.co.za",

      "fulltext": u"Learning experience: Access to education and learning opportunities has greatly increased since the overhaul of the previous inequitable, race-based education system, not least in the fields of science and mathematics. Picture: Gallo images/foto 24.\n\nAngie Motshekga\n\n\n\n South African children today enjoy far better opportunities to learn than they did 20 years ago. The tremendous challenges we still face in our school system should not cause us to forget the progress that has been made in recent times.\n\n\n\n Twenty years ago there were 13 separate education departments organised on the basis of race. Education funding, school infrastructure and the number of qualified teachers were all at much lower levels and were highly unequally distributed.\n\n\n\n Since then, under a unified Department of Education (later Department of Basic Education), the financing of education has been radically reformed. At the height of apartheid, government education spending on white children was roughly nine times that spent on black children in the homelands. Research shows that the historical differentials were largely eliminated by about 2000. Spending has since become even more pro-poor. Aside from teacher pay, government now spends about five times as much on the poorest category of schools as it does on the most affluent category of schools.\n\n\n\n The more equitable spending on education has led to better resources - both physical and human resources. For example, the percentage of schools without electricity has decreased from 59% in 1994 to 14% in 2011. The data also points to improved access to learning support materials over time, especially since the introduction of the DBE Workbook initiative, which provides colour-printed workbooks for literacy and numeracy to all children in grades R to 9.\n\n\n\n Twenty years ago pupil-teacher ratios were far higher in schools that had served black children than in schools that had served white children. This has successfully been equalised and brought down to roughly 30 to one in all provinces.\n\n\n\n The introduction of no-fee schools has also contributed to better access to schooling and reduced financial strain on households. Household surveys indicate that the percentage of parents complaining about high school fees has decreased noticeably since 2004.\n\n\n\n An additional constraint to the learning capacity of children was caused by hunger. The systematic expansion of the National Schools Nutrition Programme since 1994 has reduced this constraint to the point where daily meals are now provided to approximately 80% of school children. Those not covered by the programme are in more affluent schools.\n\n\n\n A consequence of all these improvements in school provision is that more and more children have been attending school and going further in their education. For example, the percentage of 20 to 23 year olds that had completed grade 9 increased from 76% in 2002 to 85% in 2011.\n\n\n\n Access to educational facilities has improved most dramatically for young children due to the expansion of the Grade R programme since 2001. Whereas in 2002 roughly 40% of five-year-olds were attending an educational institution, this figure has risen to over 80%. Virtually all children now attend some form of pre-school education before entering Grade 1. Our focus is now on improving the quality of Grade R.\n\n\n\n This all contributes to improved opportunities to learn. The increased numbers of people reaching grade 12 and attaining a Senior Certificate bears this out. In 1990 there were 191000 matric passes. By 2000 the number had risen to 283294. Now, in 2013, there were 439779 matric passes. The numbers qualifying for university entrance is now also substantially higher than in earlier years.\n\n\n\n Despite these clearly improving trends there are still too many youths who do not reach matric and consequently lack any qualification that is well recognised in the labour market. Although factors such as financial constraints, gang involvement and family commitments play a role in dropout, the major cause of dropout is weak learning foundations.\n\n\n\n In recent years we have actively participated in various international and local assessments of learning, and these have heightened our awareness of the major challenges we now face to improve learning quality, especially in the primary school phase.\n\n\n\n Comparisons with other countries have shown that although we compare very favourably on providing access to schooling, our children perform poorly in literacy and numeracy, even compared with some other countries in southern and East Africa.\n\n\n\n Having noted the quality challenge, one should be clear that there is no evidence that the quality of learning has deteriorated over time. What has changed is that we now have much more and better information on the system's performance. In a sense we are in a better position than before because we now know the full extent of the challenge to improve the quality of education.\n\n\n\n The introduction of the Annual National Assessments is an important new intervention that provides diagnostic information to all stakeholders, especially teachers and parents, which should inform remedial teaching.\n\n\n\n We are also building a clearer picture of the priority areas for improving the quality of education. We know that there needs to be a stronger focus on Foundation Phase numeracy and literacy, especially the ability to read. We know that despite the substantial improvements in the qualifications among our teachers there is still a need to address inadequate content knowledge among many of our teachers. There is also a need to strengthen relationships of accountability throughout the system, including at the local level between parents and schools.\n\n\n\n There are encouraging signs that learning quality is on the increase. In particular, the recent cross-country TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science) study, conducted by an independent body, demonstrated substantial improvements in mathematics and science at the grade 9 level between 2002 and 2011. Not only did the country's average level of achievement improve, but learning outcomes were less unequally distributed in 2011 than they were in 2002. This bodes well for a more equal South Africa.\n\n\n\n The fact that an independent and highly rigorous assessment such as the TIMSS study has pointed to these improvements is encouraging news and shows we are beginning to finally turn the ship. However, it must be emphasised that the level of performance is still far below that which we aspire to in South Africa.\n\n\n\n Education change is a slow and painstaking process. In the last 20 years we have overhauled an unequal and discriminatory system, increased access to schooling and begun to create the enabling conditions for quality improvements.\n\n\n\n While challenges remain in the areas of resourcing and infrastructure, the key challenge in the next 20 years is clear: we need to improve the quality of instruction in classrooms and ultimately the amount of learning taking place in our schools.\n\n\n\n More schools have received water, sanitation and electrification and many more continue to do so. The Accelerated Infrastructure Delivery Initiative (Asidi), together with the provincial infrastructure programme, constitute the backbone of both the Strategic Integrated Project 13 (Sip 13) and the National School Built Programme of the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Committee. We will continue as a sector to do all that's possible to build on the gains we have made to improve the quality of education for the sake of our children and that of our country as a whole.\n\n\n\nAngie Motshekga is Minister of Basic Education",

      "fulltext": u"Edna Molewa\n\n\n\n The government is making great strides in delivering on its mandate of water resources protection and water service delivery for the country's people and the national economy.\n\n\n\n As the country prepares to embark on its third decade of democratic governance, the government remains resolutely and wholly committed to delivering on its important mandate of water resources protection, delivering water to the people of our country and ensuring that South Africa is a water-secure country. If one looks back to 1994, only 59% of citizens had access to clean and safe drinking water, whereas today, the national average is 95.2%. Increased efforts are now focused on addressing remaining issues of water equity and redistribution.\n\n\n\n It is therefore inaccurate for the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) to state, in a recent article that the state views water simply as a commodity and does not protect water as a basic human right.\n\n\n\n The Department of Water Affairs firmly disputes the basis of this article due to the fact that an accurate reading of the section of the Constitution, that addresses the right of access to food and water section 27(1) and 27(2), deals with the “progressive realisation of these rights”.\n\n\n\n This specific and important wording in the Constitution acknowledges the limitations of the state in terms of the resources available to meet the significant challenges and demands for water, but also recognises the fact that such rights can't be practically realised overnight.\n\n\n\n Government has invested significant resources in a range of highly focused programmes that are actively working towards the realisation of this human right, one of which is the free basic water policy that directly benefits the poor in SA.\n\n\n\n The budget allocated to the Department of Water Affairs annually amounts to R20bn and this funding is directed at these programmes to ensure the efficient water management in SA, both for domestic and strategic use. This represents a significant investment and illustrates the level of importance attributed to the provision of water to all citizens.\n\n\n\n The same article by the SAHRC goes on to state that: “The result is that most of South Africa's water is used by business, especially agribusiness, mining, and other industries, at a relatively lower cost per kilolitre than poor households.” This claim is not only grossly incorrect, but also irresponsible. The reality is that industry only uses 3% of our available water in this country, and domestic use stands at 27%. The biggest remaining portion is focused on providing the country's agricultural sector with essential irrigation needed to grow crops and to ensure our current and future food security - that is critical to the wellbeing of all South African citizens. Water has a critical strategic role in growing the economy and is an important contributor to national development. Industry sectors such as the mining and manufacturing sectors require water in their processes and it is a fundamental factor in their growth, but in turn these industries contribute a great deal to SA's economy.\n\n\n\n It is therefore critical that SA's water management strategies support industrial growth and development, for example, in the agriculture sector, as around 8.5 million people are directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture for employment and income.\n\n\n\n The New Growth Path (NGP) has set a target of 300000 households in smallholder schemes by 2020 and 145000 jobs to be created in agro-processing by 2020.\n\n\n\n The agriculture sector has a huge socio-economic impact in rural communities, and water is fundamental to the growth of this sector. It is imperative for government to focus on this sector because it is also the biggest employer in rural communities, and is fundamental to guaranteeing food security in SA for its citizens.\n\n\n\n The energy sector is also strategically important to the future growth and development of the country and directly relies on the supply of water for power generation. Although it uses only 2% of the country's water resources, this sector contributes about 15% to the GDP and creates jobs for 250000 people. Water for use in the mining sector is also critical, (it contributed 8.8% directly and 10% indirectly to the GDP in 2009, as it creates about one million direct and indirect jobs. The sector accounts for about one-third of the market capitalisation of the JSE and attracts foreign investment. The NGP has set a potential employment target of 140000 new jobs by 2020 for the mining sector.\n\n\n\n Water is also critical to the manufacturing sector, which contributed 15.5% to the GDP and 13.3% to jobs in 2009. The NGP has set a target of 350000 new jobs for this sector by 2020. As a result, the claim by SAHRC that the government focuses on industry for the priority supply of water - while at the same time ignoring water as a human rights issue - is simply not supported by empirical evidence and does not appreciate the importance of industry in SA's growth and development, which benefits all citizens.\n\n\n\n Another inaccurate claim refers to the water tariffs paid by business being less per kilolitre compared to the poor households. The reality is very different - the current pricing strategy does not discriminate between domestic users and industry in terms of tariffs. The new strategy being proposed, however, makes a key differentiation acknowledging that industry makes a profit from water whereas domestic users do not, therefore they cannot be expected to pay the same tariff as industry.\n\n\n\n On the issue of transparency and public participation in the delivery of basic services and access to information around the provision of water and sanitation, government runs a consistent programme of public participation and has created various stakeholder engagement platforms.\n\n\n\n The creation of toll-free information services, a Presidential Hotline, Izimbizo and social media platforms, have all ensured that government information is freely available for interrogation and use by the public and organisations such as the SAHRC. In addition, around concerns relating to governance and budgeting issues, the government is open to engagement with stakeholders on improving the models of governance and budgeting and to enhance the efficacy of its systems in this regard.\n\n\n\n Addressing concerns around allegations of corruption and its impact on service delivery, government has harshly condemned such activity and has put in place systems to combat corruption wherever it occurs.\n\n\n\n Finally, the government recognises the challenges that remain in terms of addressing the legacy of apartheid in relation to those areas which today still lack clean water and adequate sanitation and which mirror apartheid spatial geography.\n\n\n\nEdna Molewa is the Minister of Water and Environmental Affairs",

Their jobs in the formal economy are the first to be cut.Picture: Gallo Images\n\nDignity is the inherent worth and value of every human being. Humanity's birthright was silenced by apartheid's capitalist and patriarchal paradigm, which devalued, fragmented and destroyed human beings.\n\n\n\n The earth, air and water that sustain life became commodities to exploit for profit.\n\n\n\n South Africa's democratic Constitution reinstated dignity as its first founding value and as a substantive right.\n\n\n\n The Constitution's revolutionary commitment to dignity, equality and social justice can potentially transform old fault lines of political, economic and social power.\n\n\n\n For centuries, those who colonised the wealth of the world were seen as valued citizens.\n\n\n\n Their trade and profit, even though through weapons of war or pollution of the world's water, is counted as an economic contribution.\n\n\n\n Those who were poor were depicted as scroungers and scavengers, lazy wastrels, who contributed nothing to society.\n\n\n\n Contributions to social reproduction, through subsistence farming or caring for children, the elderly, those with disabilities or who are ill, or are not recognised as economic contributions.\n\n\n\n In South Africa this paradigm's dominance is reflected in an enduring apartheid spatial geography.\n\n\n\n Disaggregated statistics reveal that those who lack most rights, including water and sanitation are those who were historically deprived of their rights.\n\n\n\n They remain black and impoverished.\n\n\n\n Unequal power relegates women to “bearers of water”, who cook, clean and care. Their jobs in the formal economy are the first to be cut.\n\n\n\n They have little protection in the “informal economy” while the lack of water and sanitation increases vulnerability to violence.\n\n\n\n A global economy driven by greed for massive profit searches for low wages, poor working conditions and subsidised water. The result is one of the most unequal societies, characterised by wealth ownership by wealthy whites (who are today even wealthier) and a small black elite.\n\n\n\n Who government values and who it doesn't is reflected in decisions by the DA and ANC municipalities to build unenclosed toilets, in the rape of children and women forced to use open fields as toilets, in the pit in which six-year-old Michael Komape died, being described as a “VIP” (ventilated pit latrine).\n\n\n\n These priority choices are reflected in budgets, trade agreements and contracts with companies who are unregulated “service providers”.\n\n\n\n The four people killed by police, while protesting the lack of water in Madibeng (“place of water”) municipality demands interrogation of those priorities.\n\n\n\n Mining companies, agribusiness and tourist industries pay less per kilolitre than households in South Africa.\n\n\n\n Yet they use, waste and pollute most water, with little consequence.\n\n\n\n Madibeng's four dams include Hartbeespoort in the platinum-rich North West. The poorest live in what was a former apartheid homeland, Bophuthatswana.\n\n\n\n Apartheid's rulers nurtured compliant and easily corruptible “leaders”. Unsurprisingly, these areas remain the most corrupt. After 1994, government needed to develop the necessary infrastructure alongside a systematic capacity building programme to instil a culture of service to the poorest, across wealthy and poor municipalities. This has not happened. National Treasury this year embarks on developing financial capacity, only in big metros and municipalities, not in the poorest municipalities.\n\n\n\n In 2010-2011, in addition to ruling and ensuring that the unenclosed toilets were enclosed to uphold dignity, the commission ruled that the presidency's Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) compile a country-wide report on the right to sanitation and government's plan to address the lack of rights.\n\n\n\n The DPME provided its report in two phases in 2012 and 2013, on both water and sanitation.\n\n\n\n The commission's demand for a systemic response is affirmed by the DPME, “key water services sector weaknesses and challenges has been attributed to a lack of adequate funding and poor revenue collection leading to financial instability, a lack of technical, management and business skills, political interference and corruption, unclear municipal powers and functions”.\n\n\n\n The commission launches our report, Water and Sanitation, Life and Dignity: Accountability to People who are Poor, shortly after the 2014 budget.\n\n\n\n National Treasury needs to address the “lack of adequate funding”, strengthen financial capacity and specify that funds allocated to local government improve the lives of the poorest.\n\n\n\n For years the commission dutifully tabled reports to Parliament, including socioeconomic rights and Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) reports that show non-compliance of over 80% by local government and significant non-compliance by crucial “service delivery” departments. Parliament needs to use its oversight mandate to hold to account ministers who received this report's draft recommendations in 2013.\n\n\n\n Government's commitments to the commission include eradicating the bucket system in communities and ensuring all schools have access to water and sanitation this year.\n\n\n\n Despite daily experience of poverty's institutionalised violence, those who came to the commission's hearings believe in our constitutional democracy. They laid complaints, made submissions and used the commission's PAIA training to access information.\n\n\n\n Their insights are captured in our report and cannot be filed on forgotten shelves. Non-action by Parliament and government on the reports of a constitutionally mandated institution is a waste of South Africa's money.\n\n\n\n Political will can ensure power is deployed effectively. After Michael Komape's tragic death, the commission met with his family, community and school staff, before meeting education officials. It asked them to install decent toilets linked to proper infrastructure, which they did.\n\n\n\n After the tragic killings in the North-West, the commission met with community representatives before meeting local government representatives, proposing immediate access to clean water linked to sustainable long term solutions.\n\n\n\n The national water affairs minister secured army trucks to ensure access to water. The premier redirected water that was going to a mine - to poor communities. Yet both tragedies could have been prevented by a proactive plan and action that the commission requested from the Presidency in 2011.\n\n\n\n Our report is dedicated to Michael Komape, to those who live with daily humiliation and those injured and killed for standing up for their rights.\n\n\n\n The government has a constitutional obligation to cooperate across all spheres and departments to protect and advance human rights, which are universal, indivisible and interdependent.\n\n\n\n It has to urgently evaluate all policies, including macro-economic choices that have deepened inequality, poverty and the accompanying human rights violations.\n\n\n\n Pregs Govender, SAHRC deputy chairperson, lead water and sanitation commissioner",

      "fulltext": u"Listen to us: Residents of Zandspruit stage a violent service delivery protest. Civil society voices generally remain marginalised in our country.Picture: Herbert Matimba\n\nSouth Africa is an infinitely better place to live in today than 20 years ago. The government has correctly tabulated these gains in its 20-Year Review.\n\n\n\n However, indications are that many of the gains were notched up in the first 15 years of this journey. The last five years has seen the country losing its focus in terms of the direction and the momentum of change. It seems to be floundering precisely when certain problems are worsening - when inequality is highest and service delivery protests are spreading.\n\n\n\n In assessing the last 20 years, one part of the judgement revolves around performance of leaders in public office. In this regard, there is growing public worry about will and capacity to implement plans, stem corruption and deepen democracy. The other part of the judgement is about the intensifying problems - expressed sharply through Marikana and the service delivery protests - and whether we are ready to meet the challenges facing us.\n\n\n\n The review is based on rigorous process. In drafting it, government commissioned over 20 papers and made use of independent reviewers.\n\n\n\n The greatest achievement of the last 20 years lies in the freedom that South Africans enjoy. As the report states: “Through the Constitution of 1996, the apartheid system was dismantled and the foundation laid for a democratic state founded on the values of human dignity, human rights, freedom, non-racism, non-sexism and the rule of law.”\n\n\n\n The Constitution propagates economic rights and has also put in place well-conceived watchdog institutions. Most, including bodies such as the Human Rights Commission and the Public Protector, have sustained their “arms length” relationship with government.\n\n\n\n Government has addressed backlogs and millions of people have been reached through the rollout of electricity, housing, sanitation and rural water programmes. It has expanded the social grants programme, now assisting 16 million people with grants that prevent hunger and destitution.\n\n\n\n The review remarks that the economy has grown at an average of 3.2% a year from 1994 to 2012. Although this growth rate is higher than in years leading up to 1994, it pales when measured against plans and promises. As commentator Ebrahim Fakir notes: “The true test is society's ability to absorb its growing number of unemployed”.\n\n\n\n The economic path we have chosen remains the report's “elephant in the room”. Our “trickle-down” strategies have not vindicated themselves. While stock market companies have reaped huge profits, we have also seen:\n\n\n\n • How most households in townships and rural areas survive on less than R1000 per month.\n\n\n\n • The rise of the working poor.\n\n\n\n • Informal settlements increase in size and number.\n\n\n\n • The huge number of underfunded local governments that are unable to renew infrastructure, let alone address needs of informal settlements.\n\n\n\n There have been several nodes of progress in the last few years. Government has taken resolute steps towards a national health initiative. It has revved up a massive infrastructure programme that includes, as the report notes, the building of dams, power stations, roads and major public transport systems.\n\n\n\n These bold initiatives have helped the economy withstand the global downturns they also address key long term infrastructure needs. Government has continued to defend the system of social grants and has recently shown greater determination to widen youth access into the world of work.\n\n\n\n The question remains: do the gains equip the country to overcome the key challenges of unemployment, poverty and inequality? The answer is: yes and no. Yes, we as South Africans are sometimes too hard on ourselves. We often miss how African counterparts and observers from abroad view us. Many of these observers marvel at our assets and what we have created in a relatively short time.\n\n\n\n At the same time, it is far from clear that we are on track to realise that better life for most citizens. The review itself shows that, with one year to go, government has only met four out of 23 Millennium Development Goals.\n\n\n\n Also, government appears to lack sufficient buy-in to the National Development Plan - which the review sees as central for “the way forward”. Organised labour dislikes the plan, the private sector generally embraces the plan's incentives but refuses to make the short-term sacrifices and bold investments needed. Furthermore the metros aside, local government is in no position to help implement the plan and civil society voices remain generally marginalised.\n\n\n\n The new South Africa, with its commitment to a just and inclusive society, has come a long way, but it still has a long way to go.\n\n\n\nFrank Meintjies is an independent consultant and a visiting research fellow at Wits School of Public & Development Management",

He explained that as the first on a crime scene an officer sees things but is also assisting a team.\n\n\"So you discover things later,\" he said.\n\nThese are added to later reports.\n\nVan Rensburg said that looking over the bedroom balcony on the morning of the shooting he did see ladders outside.\n\nBut he insisted there was no window in the toilet cubicle, just the bathroom windows.\n\nBut Roux insisted there was.\n\nPistorius has pleaded not guilty to murder, which the State alleges was premeditated and could have been during an argument.\n\nPistorius is also charged with contraventions of the Firearms Control Act.\n\nHe allegedly fired a shot from a Glock pistol under a table at a Johannesburg restaurant in January 2013.\n\nOn September 30, 2012 he allegedly fired a shot from his 9mm pistol through the open sunroof of a car while driving with friends in Modderfontein.",

She told me Oscar had called her father and said that he (Oscar) needed assistance.\n\n\n\n “When they arrived he asked the father to take his gun so he could drive the woman (Reeva) to hospital,” Van Rensburg said.\n\n\n\n It was at that time that the now former investigating officer Hilton Botha arrived.\n\n\n\n “I showed him the body and we followed the trail of blood up the stairs to find where the shooting had taken place,” he said.\n\n\n\n Van Rensburg will be cross-examined by Pistorius's lawyer today. \n\n\n\n dudud@thenewage.co.za",

Listen to the full interview here.\n\nKhoury says the biggest spike in content creation around the trial was on day one, with 80,000 pieces of original content being generated worldwide.\n\nMonday saw another spike in interest and by Friday, Khoury was reporting around 1,000 unique inserts about the trial every hour.\n\nHer company's heat map reveals just how much play the story is getting worldwide.\n\nIn recent days, Australia's media coverage of the case has ramped up considerably, with that nation taking position number three worldwide.\n\nAround 42 percent of all news coverage in South Africa is devoted to the trial at the moment.\n\nIn stark contrast, coverage of the Marikana commission of inquiry is only making up 4 percent of total South African news coverage.\n\nKhoury says witnesses are also feeling the glare of the media and social media spotlight, but mentions of their names quickly diminish as they leave the stand.\n\nThe state's first witness Michelle Burger remains the most mentioned witness so far, with Darren Fresco a close second.\n\nDuring his brief stint on the stand, more than 5,000 pieces of content were generated about him.\n\nLegal teams are also making a splash on social media, but one name stands out above the rest is defence advocate Barry Roux.\n\nHe received the most mentions, which saw him become a meme star.\n\nIn terms of journalists, South African investigative reporter Debora Patta is leading the pack in terms of her reach on Twitter.\n\nPatta is covering the trial for international broadcasters.\n\nKhoury's research reveals Patta's tweets are getting six to seven times more referrals than her three closest rivals, one of whom is EWN's Barry Bateman.",

Picture: AFP.\n\nThe former colonel went through dozens of photos, taken hours after the shooting, and described how he followed a blood trail to the scene of the shooting.\n\nHe said blood was found on the staircase and in the main bedroom and en suite bathroom.Red droplets speckled the floor and walls.\n\nVan Rensburg said when he arrived at the crime scene at around 4am, there was an ambulance and security guards outside Pistorius's house.When he entered the home, he saw Steenkamp's bloodied body lying at the bottom of the staircase with towels and black bags placed over her wounds.Get all the latest developments on the EWN Oscar Pistorius portal.",

          "fulltext": u"Both Gert Saayman and Johan Vermeulen are applied scientists. Both hold a number of formal qualifications that saw them trained in forensic investigations. Both have plied their respective trades for decades. Both have much experience in acting as expert witnesses in criminal trials, and explaining their sometimes complex findings to courts.\n\nBut in the second week of the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp, forensic pathologist Saayman and ­materials analyst Vermeulen had very ­different experiences in the witness box, vividly illustrating both the advantages and the pitfalls of matching the scientific method to a system of adversarial justice.\n\nAll indications are that judgment in the Pistorius murder trial - a case that prosecutor Gerrie Nel himself described as circumstantial - will hinge on various branches of forensic science, from ballistics to pathology.\n\nThere is every reason to believe the findings drawn from the science will be highly contested; Pistorius's defence team has lined up experts to counter witnesses called by the state.\n\nDefence lead advocate Barry Roux SC did not wait to call his own witnesses to begin the legal assault on the state's version of events on the night Steenkamp died.\n\nUnusual strategy\n\n Continuing an unusual strategy implemented during bail proceedings a year ago, when Pistorius submitted a highly detailed account of the night, the defence team made no secret of the sequence of events it will present to the court - a sequence it will argue shows Pistorius did not commit murder.\n\nIt was an approach that saw Vermeulen mauled by Roux during cross-examination, pushed to participate in sometimes bizarre ­physical demonstrations of the cricket bat and door he had been tasked with examining, and forced into joining ever more complicated speculation about plausible and implausible sequences of events.\n\nSaayman, by contrast, had an easier time under cross-examination earlier in the week, with most of his findings and many of his conclusions from Steenkamp's autopsy accepted as presented.\n\nThe difference seemed rooted in a difference of approach.\n\nThe meticulous Saayman described a process that differentiated between observation and interpretation, providing a few hypotheses gingerly, with many caveats. He presented work almost entirely free of assumptions - but also of hard, testable findings.\n\nTwo approaches\n\n Whereas Saayman laid out measurements and then spoke in terms of probabilities, Vermeulen provided what he considered likely scenarios, then explained why he had reached the conclusions he had. Saayman's language was peppered with precise medical terms impenetrable to the lay person and requiring less precise explanation; Vermeulen used vaguely defined words and phrases imprecise enough to make an academic cringe.\n\nYet the decidedly more blue-collar approach to finding the truth taken by police employee Vermeulen may be preferable to Saayman's more scientifically pure approach in a court.\n\n\"You want information put to you, but you also want to have a version that silks [senior advocates] can bash around [to] see if it stands up,\" explained a court officer not involved in the matter. \"If a guy is saying, 'this is what I think happened', that is a witness we can evaluate. If a guy says, 'here is what I measured', it can lack meaning.\"\n\nBut had each been defending a thesis outside a court, or been subjected to peer review of a paper, Saayman would have succeeded where Vermeulen would fail.\n\nBoth men presented evidence not in keeping with the version of events Pistorius described on the night of Valentine's Day 2013, before and after he shot Steenkamp. Pistorius said the couple had turned in for the night hours before midnight; Saayman said Steenkamp might have eaten something several hours later. Pistorius said he was wearing his prosthetic legs when he broke down a door to reach Steenkamp; Vermeulen said it appeared that Pistorius was so low to the ground at the time that he must have been standing on his stumps.\n\nWorlds apart\n\n The manner in which they presented their findings was worlds apart. Saayman delivered what was, in effect, a mini-lecture to explain the caveats that went with his finding of when Steenkamp had had her last meal.\n\nHe noted that this problem had been closely studied because it is both important in investigating murders particularly fraught with difficulty.\n\nHe described the imprecision of the science involved. He cited the possibility of very large meals, or very small meals, affecting the time taken to digest food.\n\nHe cautioned that different types of food are digested at different speeds, that different people digest food at different speeds, and that the same person could digest food at different rates from one day to the next.\n\nHe explained that food continued to be digested after death. Only then would he allow that the probable time between meal and death was, probably, approximately, two hours.\n\nNo prosthetics\n\n Vermeulen, on the other hand, presented his theory that Pistorius was not wearing prosthetics when he broke down the toilet door in what Roux would later refer to as an \"ambush\" (the finding was not contained in the written report Vermeulen had compiled).\n\nVermeulen then found himself defending that theory from a furious attack by the defence counsel, at one point being made to balance on his knees but with his feet in the air - trying to swing a cricket bat. Roux pushed hard: What constitutes an \"unnatural\" position in which to swing a cricket bat? How many ­positions were actually tested?\n\nIf the police stood in service of the accused as much as the prosecution, as Vermeulen said, why was a version of events presented by Pistorius not tested under laboratory conditions?\n\nVermeulen, at times with a bemused expression, found his hypothesis gradually eroded through small concessions and new caveats.\n\nTo lay watchers, it appeared that Vermeulen was demolished by the defence, while Saayman held his ground.\n\nBasic principles\n\n To scientists working in the rarefied air of academia, it appeared that Vermeulen had ignored basic principles; Saayman stuck to them.\n\nTo police with a job to do, one officer commented, it seemed that Saayman lacked the guts to point the finger of accusation, whereas Vermeulen did his job.\n\nTo some judicial officers, it seemed Vermeulen provided a testable version of events, even if it were found wanting, but Saayman's approach left the court to interpret his data with too little guidance.\n\nAll of which is, of course, irrelevant, and how Judge Thokozile Masipa interpreted the evidence of each expert will only be clear when she provides a summary of evidence before delivering the verdict.\n\nIf theory holds and the history of complex cases is any guide, the court will not see any individual witness or single piece of evidence as either bolstering or undermining Pistorius's version of events, nor will it point to a smoking gun proving whether or not a murder was committed.\n\nInstead, it will consider all the information before it: as pieces of a puzzle to be weighed and tested against one another - measured for import and plausibility, and carefully fitted into the whole.\n\nCounsel for the state and defence in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius on Thursday said they had agreed to continue his trial for an additional two weeks before planning further dates.\n\nThe new dates had not been ratified by the court at the time of publication, but that was considered a formality.\n\nThe case was due to be heard between March 3 and March 20, but halfway through that period it was evident that far more time would be required - with prosecutors still painstakingly building a case and state witnesses subjected to lengthy cross-examination.\n\nThe trial is now expected to continue without interruption until April 4, with an assessment to be done towards the middle of April on how much further court time will be required and to agree on dates. - Phillip de Wet",

          "fulltext": u"Both Gert Saayman and Johan Vermeulen are applied scientists. Both hold a number of formal qualifications that saw them trained in forensic investigations. Both have plied their respective trades for decades. Both have much experience in acting as expert witnesses in criminal trials, and explaining their sometimes complex findings to courts.\n\nBut in the second week of the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp, forensic pathologist Saayman and ­materials analyst Vermeulen had very ­different experiences in the witness box, vividly illustrating both the advantages and the pitfalls of matching the scientific method to a system of adversarial justice.\n\nAll indications are that judgment in the Pistorius murder trial - a case that prosecutor Gerrie Nel himself described as circumstantial - will hinge on various branches of forensic science, from ballistics to pathology.\n\nThere is every reason to believe the findings drawn from the science will be highly contested; Pistorius's defence team has lined up experts to counter witnesses called by the state.\n\nDefence lead advocate Barry Roux SC did not wait to call his own witnesses to begin the legal assault on the state's version of events on the night Steenkamp died.\n\nUnusual strategy\n\n Continuing an unusual strategy implemented during bail proceedings a year ago, when Pistorius submitted a highly detailed account of the night, the defence team made no secret of the sequence of events it will present to the court - a sequence it will argue shows Pistorius did not commit murder.\n\nIt was an approach that saw Vermeulen mauled by Roux during cross-examination, pushed to participate in sometimes bizarre ­physical demonstrations of the cricket bat and door he had been tasked with examining, and forced into joining ever more complicated speculation about plausible and implausible sequences of events.\n\nSaayman, by contrast, had an easier time under cross-examination earlier in the week, with most of his findings and many of his conclusions from Steenkamp's autopsy accepted as presented.\n\nThe difference seemed rooted in a difference of approach.\n\nThe meticulous Saayman described a process that differentiated between observation and interpretation, providing a few hypotheses gingerly, with many caveats. He presented work almost entirely free of assumptions - but also of hard, testable findings.\n\nTwo approaches\n\n Whereas Saayman laid out measurements and then spoke in terms of probabilities, Vermeulen provided what he considered likely scenarios, then explained why he had reached the conclusions he had. Saayman's language was peppered with precise medical terms impenetrable to the lay person and requiring less precise explanation; Vermeulen used vaguely defined words and phrases imprecise enough to make an academic cringe.\n\nYet the decidedly more blue-collar approach to finding the truth taken by police employee Vermeulen may be preferable to Saayman's more scientifically pure approach in a court.\n\n\"You want information put to you, but you also want to have a version that silks [senior advocates] can bash around [to] see if it stands up,\" explained a court officer not involved in the matter. \"If a guy is saying, 'this is what I think happened', that is a witness we can evaluate. If a guy says, 'here is what I measured', it can lack meaning.\"\n\nBut had each been defending a thesis outside a court, or been subjected to peer review of a paper, Saayman would have succeeded where Vermeulen would fail.\n\nBoth men presented evidence not in keeping with the version of events Pistorius described on the night of Valentine's Day 2013, before and after he shot Steenkamp. Pistorius said the couple had turned in for the night hours before midnight; Saayman said Steenkamp might have eaten something several hours later. Pistorius said he was wearing his prosthetic legs when he broke down a door to reach Steenkamp; Vermeulen said it appeared that Pistorius was so low to the ground at the time that he must have been standing on his stumps.\n\nWorlds apart\n\n The manner in which they presented their findings was worlds apart. Saayman delivered what was, in effect, a mini-lecture to explain the caveats that went with his finding of when Steenkamp had had her last meal.\n\nHe noted that this problem had been closely studied because it is both important in investigating murders particularly fraught with difficulty.\n\nHe described the imprecision of the science involved. He cited the possibility of very large meals, or very small meals, affecting the time taken to digest food.\n\nHe cautioned that different types of food are digested at different speeds, that different people digest food at different speeds, and that the same person could digest food at different rates from one day to the next.\n\nHe explained that food continued to be digested after death. Only then would he allow that the probable time between meal and death was, probably, approximately, two hours.\n\nNo prosthetics\n\n Vermeulen, on the other hand, presented his theory that Pistorius was not wearing prosthetics when he broke down the toilet door in what Roux would later refer to as an \"ambush\" (the finding was not contained in the written report Vermeulen had compiled).\n\nVermeulen then found himself defending that theory from a furious attack by the defence counsel, at one point being made to balance on his knees but with his feet in the air - trying to swing a cricket bat. Roux pushed hard: What constitutes an \"unnatural\" position in which to swing a cricket bat? How many ­positions were actually tested?\n\nIf the police stood in service of the accused as much as the prosecution, as Vermeulen said, why was a version of events presented by Pistorius not tested under laboratory conditions?\n\nVermeulen, at times with a bemused expression, found his hypothesis gradually eroded through small concessions and new caveats.\n\nTo lay watchers, it appeared that Vermeulen was demolished by the defence, while Saayman held his ground.\n\nBasic principles\n\n To scientists working in the rarefied air of academia, it appeared that Vermeulen had ignored basic principles; Saayman stuck to them.\n\nTo police with a job to do, one officer commented, it seemed that Saayman lacked the guts to point the finger of accusation, whereas Vermeulen did his job.\n\nTo some judicial officers, it seemed Vermeulen provided a testable version of events, even if it were found wanting, but Saayman's approach left the court to interpret his data with too little guidance.\n\nAll of which is, of course, irrelevant, and how Judge Thokozile Masipa interpreted the evidence of each expert will only be clear when she provides a summary of evidence before delivering the verdict.\n\nIf theory holds and the history of complex cases is any guide, the court will not see any individual witness or single piece of evidence as either bolstering or undermining Pistorius's version of events, nor will it point to a smoking gun proving whether or not a murder was committed.\n\nInstead, it will consider all the information before it: as pieces of a puzzle to be weighed and tested against one another - measured for import and plausibility, and carefully fitted into the whole.\n\nCounsel for the state and defence in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius on Thursday said they had agreed to continue his trial for an additional two weeks before planning further dates.\n\nThe new dates had not been ratified by the court at the time of publication, but that was considered a formality.\n\nThe case was due to be heard between March 3 and March 20, but halfway through that period it was evident that far more time would be required - with prosecutors still painstakingly building a case and state witnesses subjected to lengthy cross-examination.\n\nThe trial is now expected to continue without interruption until April 4, with an assessment to be done towards the middle of April on how much further court time will be required and to agree on dates. - Phillip de Wet",

          "fulltext": u"The state and defence in the Oscar Pistorius trial sparred on Thursday over the sequence of his actions on the night he shot his girlfriend, as a door bearing bullet marks remained on display in court.\n\nThe court was also shown photographs of a blood trail leading from Pistorius's bathroom down the staircase in his house, prompting the disabled Olympic athlete to squirm in the dock.\n\nIn one of the pictures, an unsecured silver handgun could be seen lying on a grey towel, with a cellphone partially visible from underneath it and a blood smear beside it.\n\nState witness, retired policeman Giliam van Rensburg, said this was the position in which he found Pistorius's firearm after he shot dead Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year.\n\n\"The safety clip had been removed. That firearm as it is lying there, it is ready to fire,\" said Van Rensburg, who was the first policeman to arrive at the scene of the shooting.\n\nVan Rensburg, who commanded the Boschkop police station in Pretoria at the time, said when he walked into the house he saw a body covered in blood stained towels and clothes and found Pistorius in the kitchen.\n\nEmotion\n\n He was emotional and did not immediately reply when asked what had happened.\n\n\"I asked him what happened and he did not answer,\" Van Rensburg said.\n\nAt this Pistorius's defence lawyer Barry Roux SC stood up to contradict the witness: \"My Lady, actually he was very emotional, not emotional.\"\n\nPistorius has pleaded not guilty to premeditated murder, claiming that he believed there was an intruder hiding in a locked toilet cubicle in his home when he fired four shots into it, fatally wounding Steenkamp.\n\nAccording to his version of events, he then put on his prostheses, grabbed a cricket bat and broke open the toilet door.\n\nThis account was at issue for most of Thursday's proceedings as senior police forensic expert Johannes Vermeulen was grilled about the conclusions he had made from studying the marks on the meranti door.\n\nVermeulen maintained under cross-examination from Roux that - based on the height and shape of the marks - Pistorius was in fact standing on his stumps when he swung the bat at the door.\n\nMaking a case that the police investigation had been unprofessional, Roux repeatedly asked why Vermeulen had failed to probe into the provenance of a footprint on a panel of the meranti door.\n\nProof\n\n The lawyer argued that it provided proof that Pistorius had been wearing his prostheses and had tried to kick down the door, adding that an independent expert had found bits of fabric attached to the wood.\n\nRoux then proceeded to show the high court in Pretoria a picture of his client's bloodied prosthetic legs to back up his argument.\n\nThe right leg had blood streaks on it, and one of the grey ankle socks had a dark stain near the toes.\n\nVermeulen conceded that only part of the prosthesis - the shin - had been examined by him, saying he had received Pistorius's prosthetic legs without the socks, and his brief had been limited.\n\n\"I was not requested to do analysis on the prosthetic foot, except for that mark that was on the shin,\" said Vermeulen.\n\nRoux wryly commented: \"It would have been fantastic as a qualified foot print examiner seeing that mark ... to just do the test.\"\n\nDents\n\n State prosecutor Gerrie Nel returned to the subject when he re-examined Vermeulen, asking him whether the accused may have kicked the door for another reason than to gain access to the toilet cubicle, for example to intimidate the person was inside.\n\nVermeulen said this would be speculation.\n\n\"Let's speculate,\" Nel responded, to which the witness responded that the state's scenario was possible.\n\nNel also asked Vermeulen whether he could definitively say that the dents in the door were all made only after the bullet holes.\n\nHe could not, Vermeulen answered.\n\nThe questions were in line with the state's submission that Pistorius and Steenkamp had argued on the night he shot her, something the accused has denied in his sworn statement to the court as \"unfair and incorrect\".\n\nThe trial, which is being televised live, was scheduled to continue until March 20 but an assistant prosecutor indicated on Thursday that it was now likely carry on at least until April 4. - Sapa",

      "fulltext": u"Discovered by mantle geochemist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton in Canada, Graham Pearson told The Guardian that the possible body of water was not a Jules Verne-style ocean that someone could sail a boat on.\n\nThe water is held within minerals in the region of the earth's crust known as the transition zone, 410 to 660 kilometres below the surface. Most diamonds form at depths of about 150 to 200 kilometres.\n\nThe diamond in question which weighs only 0.09 grams was found to have a speck of one of those minerals called ringwoodite found in the transition zone. Minerals that are found at that depth can not be found on the surface, but when they are trapped within diamond they can reach the surface intact due to the protection the diamond provides.\n\n“These high-pressure diamonds give you a window into the deep Earth”, Pearson said in an article for the science journal Nature.\n\nGeologist have always suspected that ringwoodite is a major component of the transition zone but the mineral had only previously been synthesised in a laboratory or found in meteorites. Using infrared spectroscopy Pearson and his team discovered that the tiny speck held 1% of water by weight.\n\nPearson said that even though that doesn't sound like much when the amount of ringwoodite that is found in the transition zone is taken into account, the zone could hold as much water as all the Earth's oceans put together.\n\nPearson also told Nature that his sample could have originated from a wet spots within the transition zone which remote-sensing studies have shown that water content may vary from place to place.",

      "fulltext": u"There's a new weapon in Hlaudi Motsoeneng's arsenal: God.\n\nOr rather, a handful of fringe church leaders claiming to represent him. In his continued fight against the public protector's damning findings against him, the SABC acting chief operating officer has managed to rope in a few holy men who have prayed for \"demons\" to be cast out of the public protector's office.\n\n\"We are praying for the office of the public protector that the demons that are working in that office must be cast out … so that only the truth can be said,\" George Lebusa was quoted as saying in an SABC news insert on Thursday.\n\nAnd it wasn't any old truth he was after either, but \"the truth in the right way, at the right time for the right purpose\".\n\nThe SABC credited Lebusa as a bishop with of a group called the \"Concerned Pastors Organisation\". He has been linked to public religious support for President Jacob Zuma before, as a church administrator.\n\nThe insert featured a number of ornately dressed priests and bishops praying loudly, and at one point praying over a woman who lies prone on the floor. Another cause for concern, according to the group, was the public protector's report into Independent Electoral Commission head Pansy Tlakula, which found her responsible for improper handling relating to a leasing deal for the body's headquarters.\n\nThe appearance on the broadcaster is the latest salvo from the minority group of religious leaders who have been vocal about public protector Thuli Madonsela, following her investigations into several political elites.\n\nMadonsela's report against Motsoeneng was particularly damning, finding that he had irregularly received three salary hikes in one fiscal year, raising his salary from R1.5-million to R2.4-million.\n\nMadonsela also accused him of irregularly increasing the salaries of some staff and purging others, leading the public broadcaster to lose millions of rands in settlements and court action. To top it off, Madonsela said Motsoeneng had committed fraud by claiming he had a matric on an application form.\n\nPublic statements\n\n But Motsoeneng's friends from the church would have none of it, and appeared again on an SABC show Morning Live on Thursday to protest against the public protector's findings in a slew of public statements on the matter.\n\n\"The public protector's report is filled with inaccuracies actually,\" said Pule Mokgethi, who was also credited as a bishop, and said to be a spokesperson for a group calling itself the \"Pastors of Indigenous Christian Churches\". However there are no other Google results associated with his name or organisation beyond his appearances on behalf of Motsoeneng.\n\nMokgethi still received several minutes of prime airtime on Morning Live, and took issue with the findings of the report against Motsoeneng in detail.\n\nAnchor Leanne Manas questioned why the church was getting involved in the matter. Lebusa, who appeared with Mokgethi in the interview, said the church believed \"that the social concerns of the public are part of the ministry and the calling of the church\".\n\nThe mainstream and respected South African Council of Churches would agree, and have been vocal on several occasions about corruption in the public sector. However the ANC has distanced itself from the organisation, despite their historic partnership during the struggle, in favour of fringe and emerging church leaders who toe a more acceptable line.\n\nThe public protector has become a thorn in the flesh for the ANC-led government for some time, and the Mail & Guardian reported on Friday of ANC leaders snubbing her at a recent summit, as tensions grow over the release of her report into the R205-million worth of upgrades at Zuma's residence in Nkandla, allegedly using public funds. The unheard-of Makethi, chosen by Motsoeneng's SABC as a church leader, also took issue with the public protector.\n\n\"We are noticing a trend in [Mandonsela's] reporting that seems to cast aspersions on critical persons in the country and thereby poisons the atmosphere … we have to clear the atmosphere.\"\n\nLebusa made a last note, perhaps clarifying what his real protest was with the public protector, saying: \"These are the most critical elections for this country and will have impact on how people cast their vote.\"\n\nA number of figures have come out in support of Motsoeneng over the report, including the SABC board chairperson Ellen Zandile Tshabalala.\n\nThe first SABC news insert also included interviews with members of an organisation called the \"Friends of Hlaudi Formation\". According to the SABC, the group was planning a night vigil and march in Bloemfontein in support of Motsoeneng.\n\n'Hands off Hlaudi'\n\n A shot in the insert showed a banner featuring Motsoeneng's face, reading: \"Hands off Hlaudi\". And beneath that, inexplicably, the ANC election slogan: \"We have a good story to tell\".\n\nThe controversial Motsoeneng is known as Zuma's enforcer at the SABC, and something of a censor. He made the controversial announcement that 70% of stories should be \"positive\". He was behind a 2012 decision to cancel an SABC interview with satirical cartoonist Jonathan Shapiro (Zapiro) on the basis that the cartoons featured in the interview were insulting to Zuma.\n\nOther interviews of a political nature were also cancelled in the run up to Mangaung, and Motsoeneng has insisted an ANC representative be present whenever the party is discussed on air.\n\nShapiro described Motsoeneng as the \"ultimate nutcase deployment\" at the time.\n\n\"Motsoeneng does seem to be an extreme version of weird deployments. He doesn't know how to do his job properly and he is trying to curry favour.\"\n\nHowever, Madonsela's office is not particularly fazed by the criticism from the religious group, calling it \"unfortunate and inconsistent with the messages the public protector regularly gets from the broader faith community\", her spokesperson Kgalalelo Masibi told the M&G.\n\nShe added that the public protector and her team continuously receive support from the faith community \"in its diversity\".\n\n\"Apart from the letters and electronic messages of support, the faith community showed its support at the public protector's interfaith prayer for good governance that was held in October last year.\"",

He put it on my forehead and I called him by his name and asked him not to kill me.\"\n\nMazibuko then removed the firearm and ordered his co-accused to lock Khoza's brother and his girlfriend in a room.\n\n\"He then apologised to me, saying that he was not aware that the house he had targeted belongs to my family,\" said Khoza.\n\n\"He told me that he had already tubed my mother and also robbed her of an amount of R200...\"\n\nProsecutor Thulani Msibi asked if he knew what tubing meant and Khoza said \"yes\".\n\n\"He meant that he had used a plastic to suffocate my mother,\" explained Khoza.\n\nKhoza then asked Mazibuko if he could see his mother. He was allowed to do so, but was then stopped near the kitchen and prevented from seeing her.\n\n\"They took me to a mealie field where I managed to free myself, but they shot me in the buttocks and I fell,\" said Khoza.\n\n\"While I was lying on the ground facing down, the other one who had a gun, shot me on my right shoulder and I was unable to wake up.\"\n\nKhoza told the court he managed to get up and run to a nearby clinic.\n\nHe woke up the next day in the Shongwe Hospital.\n\n\"It was in hospital where I learnt of my mother's death. I felt very sad because I could not even attend her funeral and bid her goodbye,\" he said.\n\nMazibuko's lawyer cross-examined Khoza and asked him to explain how he knew Mazibuko before the incident.\n\n\"I first met Mazibuko back in 2010 for a period of two weeks when we were attending different cases in the same court with the same dates. He was someone known in custody because everyone was calling his name, that is where I started to notice him too,\" Khoza said.\n\n\"... His [Mazibuko's] co-accused [at the time] was my cellmate...\"\n\nThe case was postponed to 7 April.",

      "fulltext": u"This natural gas fuel initiative is the  first of it's kind in South Africa.\n\nCompressed Natural Gas (CNG) Holdings Chief Executive Officer Thabiso Mageza said the gas is more pure than petrol but performs the same.\n\nHowever the gas is currently only available from a single filling station in Langlaagte, Johannesburg.\n\n“The gas is ultra-unleaded, doesn't leak. It contains 4% of carbon molecules while petrol has 10% molecules and the gas only costs R9.99 per litre as compared to the petrol price which is currently around R14.00,” said Mageza.\n\nMageza said the vehicle has to be converted  at the CNG conversion centre. The gas is  installed in the boot and may take up a lot of space in a  small case.ht take a lot of space for a small car,” said Mageza.\n\nAnother CNG Holdings director, Zazi Dladla said,  the project could also help with youth unemployment. “The Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) is there to empower entrepreneurs to build garages in Soweto and Mamelodi, supply the gas and have more franchisees.”\n\nSakhile Khanyile NGV Gas sales-rep said the installation of the gas cylinder would be free until one-thousand vehicles have been installed with a gas cylinder.\n\n“But then we're still not sure how much it will cost to install one,” said Khanyile.\n\nThe target market for the project is taxi drivers, buses and private citizens.\n\nMEC of Roads and Transport, Ismael Vadi who also spoke during the CNG launch yesterday ( Thursday) said “government always embraces new initiatives that will help South African citizens and this initiative is consistent with our 25-years of service in transport. We have to look at other alternative sources for energy with the price of petrol going up.”\n\n“We also have a pilot project with the International Economic Development Council (IEDC) for 200 taxis in Pretoria and we noticed through that study that taxi drivers will be saving up to 30%,” said Vadi\n\nVadi  said the gas will not put petrol stations out of business but will give South Africans an option for fuel to use in their cars. Discussion are also taking place with big players around partnership.\n\nInnocent Maboma, a taxi driver at the CNG station said he has been putting the gas in his car for two days and he was happy with the results.\n\n“The gas is cheaper than petrol and it is my second time using the gas,”said Maboma.\n\nCNG Holdings is planning to expand its business and open more gas stations around Gauteng.",

I'm not willing to give a statement on this.\" -- Vermeulen, when asked about Pistorius's balance.\n\n\"If I grew up without legs, that would be a different story.

Another two were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome air defence system.\n\nThree rockets had struck during the morning, before the announcement of the renewed truce.\n\nOn Wednesday, at least 60 rockets hit Israel and Israeli warplanes pounded Gaza in response, in the worst violence around the territory since an eight-day conflict between Israel and Hamas in November 2012.\n\nDespite the tit-for-tat violence, experts said Israel was not interested in a major confrontation.\n\nThe flare-up began on Tuesday when Islamic Jihad militants fired a mortar round at Israeli troops allegedly trying to enter southern Gaza, prompting a retaliatory air strike that killed three of them.\n\nOn Wednesday, Islamic Jihad's armed wing, the Al-Quds Brigades, launched a coordinated barrage of rockets at southern Israel that continued into the night, with the group putting the number at 130.\n\nIsrael responded by hitting 29 targets across Gaza that night, including Islamic Jihad and Hamas bases.

          "fulltext": u"ANC Gauteng Chief Whip Brian Hlongwa said in a statement their planned caucus meeting with the community was disrupted by youth in Bekkersdal.\n\nThere could never be a concept of no-go areas in a democratic society.\n\n\"It is unacceptable that schooling should be disrupted as it was done today and legitimate public representatives being barred from doing their work,\" said Hlongwa.\n\n\"Problems in Bekkersdal must be resolved urgently with all stakeholders playing their role otherwise anarchy will derail democratic progress in that township.\"\n\nHe said the ruling party's understanding was that there were two major problems raised by the community.\n\nThe first was the removal of the mayor and council, constitutional matters which were being dealt with through mechanisms provided there, with the second being allegations of corruption.\n\n\"In this regard, we believe the Gauteng government together with the Greater Westonaria Concerned Residents Association have agreed on how to resolve it with programmes involving relevant state investigative institutions,\" said Hlongwa.\n\n\"So, clearly, there are commitments and [a] programme to deal with the challenges at least from the part of government, but I think as caucus we should ensure that these processes are accelerated.\"\n\nThis would mean that Bekkersdal residents must be engaged with on a continued basis and also ensure the leadership of the aggrieved also take responsibility.\n\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters said Gauteng premier Nomvula Mokonyane and other ANC members went to Bekkersdal to hand over RDP houses to the community.\n\n\"[Premier] Nomvula Mokonyane and her crew came to hand over some RDP house and seeing that the community was not interested and rejected her, they then forced themselves into Bekkersdal to campaign,\" said EFF co-ordinator Omphile Maotwe in a statement.\n\n\"We are disturbed to learn that the police accused these young school children of throwing stones at unmarked state cars, and fired rubber bullets to disperse them.\"\n\nLeader of the Concerned Residents of Bekkersdal, Thabang Wesi, told Sapa that residents were surprised when they saw bodyguards with weapons in the township.\n\nHe said the guards shot at unarmed people, mainly school pupils.\n\n\"Residents then managed to retaliate. The situation was very tense,\" he said.\n\nWesi said they would not stop anyone from voting in the upcoming elections on May 7. He however appealed to residents to vote wisely.\n\n\"If people want to vote, let them go vote but [they] must vote out the ruling party. We can see the ANC is arrogant and use force to coerce us into voting for them,\" he said.\n\nWesi questioned the logic behind the ANC's move to visit the township without consulting them first. He said other parties had visited the area with no disruptions and conflicts.\n\nMaotwe said Mokonyane must accept that the community of Bekkersdal rejects her and her leadership.\n\n\"These are the very same people she told that she does not want their dirty votes.\"\n\nGauteng police spokesman Brigadier Neville Malila was not available for comment.",

      "fulltext": u"Giliam van Rensburg told the High Court in Pretoria he was dismayed to see a colleague pick up the handgun found on Pistorius's bloodied bathroom floor without protective gloves.\n\n\"So I asked him what are you doing?\" said Van Rensburg, adding that at this the ballistics expert looked down and realised he was bare-handed.\n\n\"And then he said 'Sorry',\" said Van Rensburg, a now retired station commander who was the first policeman to arrive at Pistorius's home after he shot Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year.\n\nThe admission came as Van Rensburg was answering questions from prosecutor Gerrie Nel on day ten of the murder trial, testifying notably that there was no sign of forced entry into the disabled track star's home.\n\nPistorius contends that he shot Steenkamp through a locked door in the belief that there was an intruder hiding behind it, and has pleaded not guilty to premeditated murder.\n\nIn cross-examination, Pistorius's lawyer wasted no time in probing for further errors in the police investigation, and accused Van Rensburg of tailoring his evidence to keep former policeman Hilton Botha off the witness stand.\n\nBotha became a household name when he admitted during Pistorius's bail hearing last year that he failed to wear protective footwear when inspecting the scene of the shooting.\n\nHe was promptly pulled off the high-profile case and subsequently resigned.\n\n\"You allowed yourself to give evidence that was designed to take the place of Mr Botha... You are standing in for Mr Botha's evidence on aspects that you cannot stand in for,\" Barry Roux, for Pistorius, said.\n\nVan Rensburg denied this, adding that Botha had told him that he expected to be called to testify in the trial.\n\nBefore he launched into cross-examination, Roux had asked whether the State planned to call Botha, to which Nel responded: \"I don't know yet, My Lady. We'll decide that as the evidence comes.\"\n\nThe defence lawyer proceeded to charge that Van Rensburg's initial statement was silent on \"material facts\", implying that in his responses he was relying on observations that were in fact made by Botha.\n\nSlowly taking Van Rensburg through the police's actions in the hours and days that followed Steenkamp's shooting, he repeated like a refrain: \"Where was Mr Botha?\"\n\nVan Rensburg testified that Botha was with him when they followed a trial of blood leading up the stairs of Pistorius's home, but said he did not see his colleague touch or move anything.\n\nAsked why his statement failed to mention Botha's presence at the time, he said that in police statements \"I\" can sometimes mean \"we\".\n\nRoux asked whether the court could rely on police photographs taken at Pistorius's home as true reflections of the state in which investigators had found the scene.\n\n\"When can we rely on the scene photo as a true reflection, and when is it changed?\" he said, indicating a picture showing a cell phone lying next to a grey towel on the bathroom floor.\n\nVan Rensburg was forced to concede that initially the towel had covered the phone and said in police investigations only the first photographs should be understood to show a scene unchanged, since more were taken as police continued their work.\n\nRoux pointed out that Van Rensburg had in projections shown to him in court failed to notice the difference between sets of photographs of the same scene -- including the altered position of a pair of white flip-flops -- and asked the witness: \"How do you feel about your ability to observe?\"\n\nIt was above average, the former station commander replied modestly after a difficult morning.\n\nHe told the court he erected security barriers around Pistorius's home the scene of the shooting after an expensive watch belonging to the accused mysteriously disappeared.\n\n\"I didn't trust anyone at that stage,\" he said.\n\nVan Rensburg said when he arrived at the house, he found Steenkamp's body under bloodied coverings. Pistorius was pacing the kitchen floor and was too distraught to respond when asked what had happened.\n\n\"My deduction was that as a result of his emotional state, he was not able to answer.\"\n\nThe State did not re-examine Van Rensburg and Judge Thokozile Masipa adjourned the trial until Monday morning.\n\nThe trial is expected to continue until April 4.",

          "fulltext": u"Pretoria - A former police officer testifying in Oscar Pistorius's murder trial was put through a rigorous set of \"spot the difference\" questions on Friday.\n\nThese related to police procedure in the hours after the Paralympian shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.\n\nFormer Colonel Schoombie van Rensburg had to read through excerpts of police statements and examine photographs taken of the scene on the morning of 14 February 2013 when Pistorius shot Steenkamp.\n\nHe said he thought she was an intruder in the toilet and has pleaded not guilty to a charge of murder which the State alleges was premeditated.\n\nAdvocate Barry Roux for Pistorius, pointed out changes such as a \"Mr Steenkamp\" recorded as the person who phoned emergency services instead of a \"Mr Stander\" at the Silver Woods Estate in Pretoria.\n\nVan Rensburg initially thought he found three cellphones, but discovered that two were actually the back and front of one, and another one was pointed out by a police photographer.\n\nHe said as investigations proceeded, details changed as more observations were made.\n\nWhen the lead policeman attended to a scene, his first tour of the scene was not just to notice things but also to help colleagues. Then other things were noticed.\n\nRoux was trying to establish who had gone upstairs first to where Pistorius said he shot Steenkamp in the toilet.\n\nHe did not appear to accept Van Rensburg's explanation that it was himself and investigating officer Hilton Botha who went up first, because his statement did not mention Botha.\n\nVan Rensburg said that in police statements \"I\" can sometimes mean \"we\".\n\nVan Rensburg, the former Boschkop police station commander, had been the first policeman to arrive at the scene after attending to an armed robbery before that.\n\nHe was also present when the house was finally sealed and locked up.\n\nNow a sports coach after resigning in December, he told Roux he did not notice a difference between two pictures of the front door of Pistorius's house sealed.\n\nHe modestly described his observation skills as above average because of his work and was astounded when told the seal patterns on the door were completely different in the two photographs and that he had missed that detail.\n\nHe recovered to say the pictures on the screen shown in the court were moving very quickly and were not showed next to each other to allow comparison.\n\nShowing signs of hesitation after another question in a gruelling morning of cross-examination, Roux said: \"It's not a trick question I see you don't want to make observations anymore.\"\n\nRoux finally asked Judge Thokozile Masipa for a lunch break with his customary: \"Will this be an opportune moment?\" and court was adjourned for an hour.\n\nPistorius also faces charges under the Firearms Control Act for allegedly discharging a firearm in a restaurant in Melrose Arch, Johannesburg and out of a sunroof in the Modderfontein area.",

          "fulltext": u"Oscar Pistorius contends that he shot Steenkamp through a locked door in the belief that there was an intruder hiding behind it. (AFP)\n\nA former police officer testifying in the Oscar Pistorius murder trial admitted on Friday evidence was mishandled on the scene where the Paralympian shot Reeva Steenkamp.\n\nGiliam van Rensburg told the high court in Pretoria he was dismayed to see a colleague pick up the handgun found on Pistorius's bloodied bathroom floor without protective gloves.\n\n\"So I asked him what are you doing?\" said Van Rensburg, adding that at this the ballistics expert looked down and realised he was bare-handed. \"And then he said 'sorry',\" said Van Rensburg, a now retired station commander, who was the first policeman to arrive at Pistorius's home after he shot Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year.\n\nThe admission came as Van Rensburg was answering questions from prosecutor Gerrie Nel on day 10 of the murder trial, testifying notably that there was no sign of forced entry into the disabled track star's home.\n\nPistorius contends that he shot Steenkamp through a locked door in the belief that there was an intruder hiding behind it, and has pleaded not guilty to premeditated murder.\n\nIn cross-examination, Pistorius's lawyer wasted no time in probing for further errors in the police investigation, and accused Van Rensburg of tailoring his evidence to keep former policeman Hilton Botha off the witness stand.\n\nResignation\n\nBotha admitted during Pistorius's bail hearing last year that he failed to wear protective footwear when inspecting the scene of the shooting. He was promptly pulled off the high-profile case and subsequently resigned.\n\n\"You allowed yourself to give evidence that was designed to take the place of Mr Botha ... You are standing in for Mr Botha's evidence on aspects that you cannot stand in for,\" Barry Roux, for Pistorius, said.\n\nVan Rensburg denied this, adding that Botha had told him that he expected to be called to testify in the trial.\n\nBefore he launched into cross-examination, Roux had asked whether the state planned to call Botha, to which Nel responded: \"I don't know yet, My Lady. We'll decide that as the evidence comes.\"\n\nThe defence lawyer proceeded to charge that Van Rensburg's initial statement was silent on \"material facts\", implying that in his responses he was relying on observations that were in fact made by Botha.\n\nSlowly taking Van Rensburg through the police's actions in the hours and days that followed Steenkamp's shooting, he repeated like a refrain: \"Where was Mr Botha?\"\n\nVan Rensburg testified that Botha was with him when they followed a trial of blood leading up the stairs of Pistorius's home, but said he did not see his colleague touch or move anything. Asked why his statement failed to mention Botha's presence at the time, he said that in police statements \"I\" can sometimes mean \"we\".\n\nTrue reflection\n\n Roux asked whether the court could rely on police photographs taken at Pistorius's home as true reflections of the state in which investigators had found the scene. \"When can we rely on the scene photo as a true reflection, and when is it changed?\" he said, indicating a picture showing a cell phone lying next to a grey towel on the bathroom floor.\n\nVan Rensburg was forced to concede that initially the towel had covered the phone and said in police investigations only the first photographs should be understood to show a scene unchanged, since more were taken as police continued their work.\n\nRoux pointed out that Van Rensburg had in projections shown to him in court failed to notice the difference between sets of photographs of the same scene - including the altered position of a pair of white flip-flops - and asked the witness: \"How do you feel about your ability to observe?\"\n\nIt was above average, the former station commander replied modestly after a difficult morning.\n\nHe told the court he erected security barriers around Pistorius's home the scene of the shooting after an expensive watch belonging to the accused mysteriously disappeared. \"I didn't trust anyone at that stage,\" he said.\n\nVan Rensburg said when he arrived at the house, he found Steenkamp's body under bloodied coverings. Pistorius was pacing the kitchen floor and was too distraught to respond when asked what had happened.\n\n\"My deduction was that as a result of his emotional state, he was not able to answer.\"\n\nThe state did not re-examine Van Rensburg and Judge Thokozile Masipa adjourned the trial until Monday morning.\n\nThe trial is expected to continue until April 4. - Sapa",

He is very generous with his time and with his love and empathy.\n\n\n\n\"Oscar is just very special. That's why it is very difficult to understand what is going on here now.\"\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir sat in the back row of the public gallery in the North Gauteng High Court from 3-13 March.\n\n\n\n‘Just like Pistorius'\n\n\n\nShe cried in court on Monday, when pathologist Professor Gert Saayman described Steenkamp's wounds. Pistorius himself was emotional and was retching in the dock as Saayman spoke.\n\n\n\nSaayman said Steenkamp died as a result of multiple gun shots.\n\n\n\nPistorius is on trial for the murder of Steenkamp who was shot through a locked bathroom door of his Pretoria home on 14 February last year. He said he had mistaken her for an intruder.\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir said it was important to show physical support for the 27-year-old athlete who had been her friend for almost nine years.\n\n\n\n\"He was always there for us when we needed comfort. It is no tragedy to have a child who has no legs but there are difficult moments,\" she said emotionally.\n\n\n\n\"He was always there for us, so that's why we want to be here now when he needs friends. We wanted to give him physical support because that's what he gave to us.\"\n\n\n\nHer eight-year-old son Halli was \"just like Pistorius\" and he was born with missing fibulae bones, she said. Both his legs were amputated when he was 11 months old.\n\n\n\nBorn without fibulae, Pistorius had both his lower legs amputated before he was a year old.\n\n\n\nHe was the poster-boy of ambition and overcame adversity, becoming the first amputee to compete on the track in the able-bodied Olympics in 2012.\n\n\n\nHeartfelt gratitude\n\n\n\nAn emotional Gudmundstottir remembered how she befriended Pistorius.\n\n\n\nDoctors told Gudmundstottir when she was 20 weeks pregnant with her son that he would be born with no legs.\n\n\n\nShe remembered how worried, scared and confused she was because there was no record of a child being born like that in Iceland.\n\n\n\nShe said then they googled \"double-amputee\" and found a photograph of Pistorius running in the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens.\n\n\n\n\"I can't explain how happy I was [when I found the photograph] because I did not know what it meant when they told me my son did not have legs,\" Gudmundstottir recalled.\n\n\n\n\"I just really did not understand it. I did not know anybody with no legs so seeing this was like a miracle to me.\"\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir said her mother, who was also in court to support Pistorius, contacted a journalist who interviewed the athlete and asked him to convey the family's heartfelt gratitude for having been there \"without knowing it\".\n\n\n\nHer face lit up as she remembered the reply from Pistorius.\n\n\n\n\"He wrote my mom back and said 'hi I'm Oscar Pistorius, were you looking for me' with a smiley face,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"Then he said if there is anything I can help you with, just let me know.\"\n\n\n\nPatriotic\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir said they started corresponding and a year later he went to Iceland because of his blades and asked to meet the family.\n\n\n\nThe Gudmundstottir's invited him to their home and said as a family they had peace of mind after seeing Pistorius and seeing what he had accomplished.\n\n\n\n\"Oscar was extremely polite, and kind. He told jokes, he was just very kind to both my children. It was very obvious what kind of a person he is,\" she said.\n\n\n\nPistorius and the Gudmundstottirs became close and the family went to Manchester, in London, to see him run.\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir remembered one athletics meet when Pistorius won a gold medal and they were on a hill nearby.\n\n\n\n\"Oscar came running to us and he put his gold medal around my son's neck and he said to him 'this is for you champion' and my son was just beaming with joy,\" she recalled with tears in her yes.\n\n\n\nPistorius also showed Halli, who was three at the time, that they were the same which made the toddler beam with joy, she said.\n\n\n\n\"Halli was happy because in Iceland he is always the only one who doesn't have any legs, so it was a lovely thing to do,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"Oscar means a lot to us and we know him well.\"\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir said the athlete was patriotic and showed them pictures of South Africa.\n\n\n\n\"He loves his country, he loves the people, he loves the food and is always bragging about it,\" she said.\n\n\n\nGudmundstottir said she would continue to support her friend despite returning to Iceland on Thursday.

Picture: AFP\n\nMichael Appel\n\n\n\n If we in the media are feeling fatigued by now, one wouldn't even want to venture a guess how murder accused Oscar Pistorius is feeling as the second week of his trial winds to a close today.\n\n\n\n Without a doubt, it's been a tough week for the Paralympian, emotionally in particular.\n\n\n\n He's had his friends take the stand to talk the world through what was intimate moments among pals and he's been painted as a cocky, arrogant, responsibility-dodging hothead by telling testimony from friend, or former friend, Darren Fresco.\n\n\n\n Fresco gave insight into what transpired in his car on the day in September 2012 when Pistorius allegedly fired off a round through his sunroof “without warning”.\n\n\n\n Fresco, also involved in the Tasha restaurant's accidental shooting incident in January last year, gave his version of events that led to the athlete discharging his firearm in the busy restaurant.\n\n\n\n His version of events, what pro boxer Kevin Lerena attested to happened in Tasha's and Pistorius's version of events all differ.\n\n\n\n Interesting how three different versions of the same event have so far been offered to the court.\n\n\n\n Regardless of the strength of Fresco's evidence as a state witness, many will argue that his testimony achieved what it set out to do - taint the wholesome role-model image of the Blade Runner.\n\n\n\n What perhaps stands out most as the second week of his trial comes to an end, is the world's fascination with the Paralympian's reaction to the graphic post-mortem testimony led in court.\n\n\n\n Pathologist Prof Gert Saayman spared no detail in describing, very clinically, the gunshot wounds sustained by law graduate and model Reeva Steenkamp.\n\n\n\n We know that the bullets that were used were Black Talon hollow points, designed to cause “maximum tissue damage”.\n\n\n\n Significantly, Saayman made mention of the fact that “it would be abnormal for someone not to scream”, even after being shot in the head.\n\n\n\n This from an experienced and respected pathologist strongly casts doubt on the defence's version that Steenkamp would not have been able to scream due to the incapacitating head wound.\n\n\n\n On Tuesday, the fatality of her wounds was described to the court resulting in a cacophony of what media houses labelled “retching noises” coming from the visibly distraught athlete.\n\n\n\n The entrance of social media platform Twitter into everyday journalism has given every hack the ability to bring their followers into the court room with them.\n\n\n\n Every gesture Pistorius makes, every smile, every frown, every head-in-hands moment is broadcast almost simultaneously to cell phones, tablets and computers around the world.\n\n\n\n Retired Col Schoombie van Rensburg, the former station commander at Boschkop police station, yesterday painstakingly walked the court through his every footstep as blood splatter after blood splatter photo of his trail through the house was presented to the court.\n\n\n\n The defence is expected to come out strongly on just how so much blood splatter ended up on what many would consider unlikely places in the home.\n\n\n\n There was blood splatter on a pillar downstairs, his duvet, the stairway walls, in the bath, in the basin and even on a small cabinet containing eight of Pistorius's wristwatches in his bedroom.\n\n\n\n Before week three even gets under way on Monday, the National Prosecuting Authority has said that the case is likely to drag on well into April.\n\n\n\n If you're already suffering from overexposure to the constant stream of news coming from the trial, settle down, it may be a long one.\n\n\n\n michaela@thenewage.co.za\n\n",

This week has seen extensive testimony regarding the marks on the door and how they might have come to be there.\n\nMemes aren't the only place that the trial is being spoofed - an Instagram account called LegoPistorius is also gaining traction.

Both have much experience in acting as expert witnesses in criminal trials, and explaining their sometimes complex findings to courts.\n\nBut in the second week of the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp, forensic pathologist Saayman and ­materials analyst Vermeulen had very ­different experiences in the witness box, vividly illustrating both the advantages and the pitfalls of matching the scientific method to a system of adversarial justice.\n\nAll indications are that judgment in the Pistorius murder trial - a case that prosecutor Gerrie Nel himself described as circumstantial - will hinge on various branches of forensic science, from ballistics to pathology.\n\nThere is every reason to believe the findings drawn from the science will be highly contested; Pistorius's defence team has lined up experts to counter witnesses called by the state.\n\nDefence lead advocate Barry Roux SC did not wait to call his own witnesses to begin the legal assault on the state's version of events on the night Steenkamp died.\n\nUnusual strategy\n\n Continuing an unusual strategy implemented during bail proceedings a year ago, when Pistorius submitted a highly detailed account of the night, the defence team made no secret of the sequence of events it will present to the court - a sequence it will argue shows Pistorius did not commit murder.\n\nIt was an approach that saw Vermeulen mauled by Roux during cross-examination, pushed to participate in sometimes bizarre ­physical demonstrations of the cricket bat and door he had been tasked with examining, and forced into joining ever more complicated speculation about plausible and implausible sequences of events.\n\nSaayman, by contrast, had an easier time under cross-examination earlier in the week, with most of his findings and many of his conclusions from Steenkamp's autopsy accepted as presented.\n\nThe difference seemed rooted in a difference of approach.\n\nThe meticulous Saayman described a process that differentiated between observation and interpretation, providing a few hypotheses gingerly, with many caveats. He presented work almost entirely free of assumptions - but also of hard, testable findings.\n\nTwo approaches\n\n Whereas Saayman laid out measurements and then spoke in terms of probabilities, Vermeulen provided what he considered likely scenarios, then explained why he had reached the conclusions he had. Saayman's language was peppered with precise medical terms impenetrable to the lay person and requiring less precise explanation; Vermeulen used vaguely defined words and phrases imprecise enough to make an academic cringe.\n\nYet the decidedly more blue-collar approach to finding the truth taken by police employee Vermeulen may be preferable to Saayman's more scientifically pure approach in a court.\n\n\"You want information put to you, but you also want to have a version that silks [senior advocates] can bash around [to] see if it stands up,\" explained a court officer not involved in the matter. \"If a guy is saying, 'this is what I think happened', that is a witness we can evaluate. If a guy says, 'here is what I measured', it can lack meaning.\"\n\nBut had each been defending a thesis outside a court, or been subjected to peer review of a paper, Saayman would have succeeded where Vermeulen would fail.\n\nBoth men presented evidence not in keeping with the version of events Pistorius described on the night of Valentine's Day 2013, before and after he shot Steenkamp. Pistorius said the couple had turned in for the night hours before midnight; Saayman said Steenkamp might have eaten something several hours later. Pistorius said he was wearing his prosthetic legs when he broke down a door to reach Steenkamp; Vermeulen said it appeared that Pistorius was so low to the ground at the time that he must have been standing on his stumps.\n\nWorlds apart\n\n The manner in which they presented their findings was worlds apart. Saayman delivered what was, in effect, a mini-lecture to explain the caveats that went with his finding of when Steenkamp had had her last meal.\n\nHe noted that this problem had been closely studied because it is both important in investigating murders particularly fraught with difficulty.\n\nHe described the imprecision of the science involved. He cited the possibility of very large meals, or very small meals, affecting the time taken to digest food.\n\nHe cautioned that different types of food are digested at different speeds, that different people digest food at different speeds, and that the same person could digest food at different rates from one day to the next.\n\nHe explained that food continued to be digested after death. Only then would he allow that the probable time between meal and death was, probably, approximately, two hours.\n\nNo prosthetics\n\n Vermeulen, on the other hand, presented his theory that Pistorius was not wearing prosthetics when he broke down the toilet door in what Roux would later refer to as an \"ambush\" (the finding was not contained in the written report Vermeulen had compiled).\n\nVermeulen then found himself defending that theory from a furious attack by the defence counsel, at one point being made to balance on his knees but with his feet in the air - trying to swing a cricket bat. Roux pushed hard: What constitutes an \"unnatural\" position in which to swing a cricket bat? How many ­positions were actually tested?\n\nIf the police stood in service of the accused as much as the prosecution, as Vermeulen said, why was a version of events presented by Pistorius not tested under laboratory conditions?\n\nVermeulen, at times with a bemused expression, found his hypothesis gradually eroded through small concessions and new caveats.\n\nTo lay watchers, it appeared that Vermeulen was demolished by the defence, while Saayman held his ground.\n\nBasic principles\n\n To scientists working in the rarefied air of academia, it appeared that Vermeulen had ignored basic principles; Saayman stuck to them.\n\nTo police with a job to do, one officer commented, it seemed that Saayman lacked the guts to point the finger of accusation, whereas Vermeulen did his job.\n\nTo some judicial officers, it seemed Vermeulen provided a testable version of events, even if it were found wanting, but Saayman's approach left the court to interpret his data with too little guidance.\n\nAll of which is, of course, irrelevant, and how Judge Thokozile Masipa interpreted the evidence of each expert will only be clear when she provides a summary of evidence before delivering the verdict.\n\nIf theory holds and the history of complex cases is any guide, the court will not see any individual witness or single piece of evidence as either bolstering or undermining Pistorius's version of events, nor will it point to a smoking gun proving whether or not a murder was committed.\n\nInstead, it will consider all the information before it: as pieces of a puzzle to be weighed and tested against one another - measured for import and plausibility, and carefully fitted into the whole.\n\nCounsel for the state and defence in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius on Thursday said they had agreed to continue his trial for an additional two weeks before planning further dates.\n\nThe new dates had not been ratified by the court at the time of publication, but that was considered a formality.\n\nThe case was due to be heard between March 3 and March 20, but halfway through that period it was evident that far more time would be required - with prosecutors still painstakingly building a case and state witnesses subjected to lengthy cross-examination.\n\nThe trial is now expected to continue without interruption until April 4, with an assessment to be done towards the middle of April on how much further court time will be required and to agree on dates. - Phillip de Wet",

          "fulltext": u"Both Gert Saayman and Johan Vermeulen are applied scientists. Both hold a number of formal qualifications that saw them trained in forensic investigations. Both have plied their respective trades for decades. Both have much experience in acting as expert witnesses in criminal trials, and explaining their sometimes complex findings to courts.\n\nBut in the second week of the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp, forensic pathologist Saayman and ­materials analyst Vermeulen had very ­different experiences in the witness box, vividly illustrating both the advantages and the pitfalls of matching the scientific method to a system of adversarial justice.\n\nAll indications are that judgment in the Pistorius murder trial - a case that prosecutor Gerrie Nel himself described as circumstantial - will hinge on various branches of forensic science, from ballistics to pathology.\n\nThere is every reason to believe the findings drawn from the science will be highly contested; Pistorius's defence team has lined up experts to counter witnesses called by the state.\n\nDefence lead advocate Barry Roux SC did not wait to call his own witnesses to begin the legal assault on the state's version of events on the night Steenkamp died.\n\nUnusual strategy\n\n Continuing an unusual strategy implemented during bail proceedings a year ago, when Pistorius submitted a highly detailed account of the night, the defence team made no secret of the sequence of events it will present to the court - a sequence it will argue shows Pistorius did not commit murder.\n\nIt was an approach that saw Vermeulen mauled by Roux during cross-examination, pushed to participate in sometimes bizarre ­physical demonstrations of the cricket bat and door he had been tasked with examining, and forced into joining ever more complicated speculation about plausible and implausible sequences of events.\n\nSaayman, by contrast, had an easier time under cross-examination earlier in the week, with most of his findings and many of his conclusions from Steenkamp's autopsy accepted as presented.\n\nThe difference seemed rooted in a difference of approach.\n\nThe meticulous Saayman described a process that differentiated between observation and interpretation, providing a few hypotheses gingerly, with many caveats. He presented work almost entirely free of assumptions - but also of hard, testable findings.\n\nTwo approaches\n\n Whereas Saayman laid out measurements and then spoke in terms of probabilities, Vermeulen provided what he considered likely scenarios, then explained why he had reached the conclusions he had. Saayman's language was peppered with precise medical terms impenetrable to the lay person and requiring less precise explanation; Vermeulen used vaguely defined words and phrases imprecise enough to make an academic cringe.\n\nYet the decidedly more blue-collar approach to finding the truth taken by police employee Vermeulen may be preferable to Saayman's more scientifically pure approach in a court.\n\n\"You want information put to you, but you also want to have a version that silks [senior advocates] can bash around [to] see if it stands up,\" explained a court officer not involved in the matter. \"If a guy is saying, 'this is what I think happened', that is a witness we can evaluate. If a guy says, 'here is what I measured', it can lack meaning.\"\n\nBut had each been defending a thesis outside a court, or been subjected to peer review of a paper, Saayman would have succeeded where Vermeulen would fail.\n\nBoth men presented evidence not in keeping with the version of events Pistorius described on the night of Valentine's Day 2013, before and after he shot Steenkamp. Pistorius said the couple had turned in for the night hours before midnight; Saayman said Steenkamp might have eaten something several hours later. Pistorius said he was wearing his prosthetic legs when he broke down a door to reach Steenkamp; Vermeulen said it appeared that Pistorius was so low to the ground at the time that he must have been standing on his stumps.\n\nWorlds apart\n\n The manner in which they presented their findings was worlds apart. Saayman delivered what was, in effect, a mini-lecture to explain the caveats that went with his finding of when Steenkamp had had her last meal.\n\nHe noted that this problem had been closely studied because it is both important in investigating murders particularly fraught with difficulty.\n\nHe described the imprecision of the science involved. He cited the possibility of very large meals, or very small meals, affecting the time taken to digest food.\n\nHe cautioned that different types of food are digested at different speeds, that different people digest food at different speeds, and that the same person could digest food at different rates from one day to the next.\n\nHe explained that food continued to be digested after death. Only then would he allow that the probable time between meal and death was, probably, approximately, two hours.\n\nNo prosthetics\n\n Vermeulen, on the other hand, presented his theory that Pistorius was not wearing prosthetics when he broke down the toilet door in what Roux would later refer to as an \"ambush\" (the finding was not contained in the written report Vermeulen had compiled).\n\nVermeulen then found himself defending that theory from a furious attack by the defence counsel, at one point being made to balance on his knees but with his feet in the air - trying to swing a cricket bat. Roux pushed hard: What constitutes an \"unnatural\" position in which to swing a cricket bat? How many ­positions were actually tested?\n\nIf the police stood in service of the accused as much as the prosecution, as Vermeulen said, why was a version of events presented by Pistorius not tested under laboratory conditions?\n\nVermeulen, at times with a bemused expression, found his hypothesis gradually eroded through small concessions and new caveats.\n\nTo lay watchers, it appeared that Vermeulen was demolished by the defence, while Saayman held his ground.\n\nBasic principles\n\n To scientists working in the rarefied air of academia, it appeared that Vermeulen had ignored basic principles; Saayman stuck to them.\n\nTo police with a job to do, one officer commented, it seemed that Saayman lacked the guts to point the finger of accusation, whereas Vermeulen did his job.\n\nTo some judicial officers, it seemed Vermeulen provided a testable version of events, even if it were found wanting, but Saayman's approach left the court to interpret his data with too little guidance.\n\nAll of which is, of course, irrelevant, and how Judge Thokozile Masipa interpreted the evidence of each expert will only be clear when she provides a summary of evidence before delivering the verdict.\n\nIf theory holds and the history of complex cases is any guide, the court will not see any individual witness or single piece of evidence as either bolstering or undermining Pistorius's version of events, nor will it point to a smoking gun proving whether or not a murder was committed.\n\nInstead, it will consider all the information before it: as pieces of a puzzle to be weighed and tested against one another - measured for import and plausibility, and carefully fitted into the whole.\n\nCounsel for the state and defence in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius on Thursday said they had agreed to continue his trial for an additional two weeks before planning further dates.\n\nThe new dates had not been ratified by the court at the time of publication, but that was considered a formality.\n\nThe case was due to be heard between March 3 and March 20, but halfway through that period it was evident that far more time would be required - with prosecutors still painstakingly building a case and state witnesses subjected to lengthy cross-examination.\n\nThe trial is now expected to continue without interruption until April 4, with an assessment to be done towards the middle of April on how much further court time will be required and to agree on dates. - Phillip de Wet",

He explained that as the first on a crime scene an officer sees things but is also assisting a team.\n\n\"So you discover things later,\" he said.\n\nThese are added to later reports.\n\nVan Rensburg said that looking over the bedroom balcony on the morning of the shooting he did see ladders outside.\n\nBut he insisted there was no window in the toilet cubicle, just the bathroom windows.\n\nBut Roux insisted there was.\n\nPistorius has pleaded not guilty to murder, which the State alleges was premeditated and could have been during an argument.\n\nPistorius is also charged with contraventions of the Firearms Control Act.\n\nHe allegedly fired a shot from a Glock pistol under a table at a Johannesburg restaurant in January 2013.\n\nOn September 30, 2012 he allegedly fired a shot from his 9mm pistol through the open sunroof of a car while driving with friends in Modderfontein.",

Picture: AFP.\n\nThe former colonel went through dozens of photos, taken hours after the shooting, and described how he followed a blood trail to the scene of the shooting.\n\nHe said blood was found on the staircase and in the main bedroom and en suite bathroom.Red droplets speckled the floor and walls.\n\nVan Rensburg said when he arrived at the crime scene at around 4am, there was an ambulance and security guards outside Pistorius's house.When he entered the home, he saw Steenkamp's bloodied body lying at the bottom of the staircase with towels and black bags placed over her wounds.Get all the latest developments on the EWN Oscar Pistorius portal.",

          "fulltext": u"Both Gert Saayman and Johan Vermeulen are applied scientists. Both hold a number of formal qualifications that saw them trained in forensic investigations. Both have plied their respective trades for decades. Both have much experience in acting as expert witnesses in criminal trials, and explaining their sometimes complex findings to courts.\n\nBut in the second week of the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp, forensic pathologist Saayman and ­materials analyst Vermeulen had very ­different experiences in the witness box, vividly illustrating both the advantages and the pitfalls of matching the scientific method to a system of adversarial justice.\n\nAll indications are that judgment in the Pistorius murder trial - a case that prosecutor Gerrie Nel himself described as circumstantial - will hinge on various branches of forensic science, from ballistics to pathology.\n\nThere is every reason to believe the findings drawn from the science will be highly contested; Pistorius's defence team has lined up experts to counter witnesses called by the state.\n\nDefence lead advocate Barry Roux SC did not wait to call his own witnesses to begin the legal assault on the state's version of events on the night Steenkamp died.\n\nUnusual strategy\n\n Continuing an unusual strategy implemented during bail proceedings a year ago, when Pistorius submitted a highly detailed account of the night, the defence team made no secret of the sequence of events it will present to the court - a sequence it will argue shows Pistorius did not commit murder.\n\nIt was an approach that saw Vermeulen mauled by Roux during cross-examination, pushed to participate in sometimes bizarre ­physical demonstrations of the cricket bat and door he had been tasked with examining, and forced into joining ever more complicated speculation about plausible and implausible sequences of events.\n\nSaayman, by contrast, had an easier time under cross-examination earlier in the week, with most of his findings and many of his conclusions from Steenkamp's autopsy accepted as presented.\n\nThe difference seemed rooted in a difference of approach.\n\nThe meticulous Saayman described a process that differentiated between observation and interpretation, providing a few hypotheses gingerly, with many caveats. He presented work almost entirely free of assumptions - but also of hard, testable findings.\n\nTwo approaches\n\n Whereas Saayman laid out measurements and then spoke in terms of probabilities, Vermeulen provided what he considered likely scenarios, then explained why he had reached the conclusions he had. Saayman's language was peppered with precise medical terms impenetrable to the lay person and requiring less precise explanation; Vermeulen used vaguely defined words and phrases imprecise enough to make an academic cringe.\n\nYet the decidedly more blue-collar approach to finding the truth taken by police employee Vermeulen may be preferable to Saayman's more scientifically pure approach in a court.\n\n\"You want information put to you, but you also want to have a version that silks [senior advocates] can bash around [to] see if it stands up,\" explained a court officer not involved in the matter. \"If a guy is saying, 'this is what I think happened', that is a witness we can evaluate. If a guy says, 'here is what I measured', it can lack meaning.\"\n\nBut had each been defending a thesis outside a court, or been subjected to peer review of a paper, Saayman would have succeeded where Vermeulen would fail.\n\nBoth men presented evidence not in keeping with the version of events Pistorius described on the night of Valentine's Day 2013, before and after he shot Steenkamp. Pistorius said the couple had turned in for the night hours before midnight; Saayman said Steenkamp might have eaten something several hours later. Pistorius said he was wearing his prosthetic legs when he broke down a door to reach Steenkamp; Vermeulen said it appeared that Pistorius was so low to the ground at the time that he must have been standing on his stumps.\n\nWorlds apart\n\n The manner in which they presented their findings was worlds apart. Saayman delivered what was, in effect, a mini-lecture to explain the caveats that went with his finding of when Steenkamp had had her last meal.\n\nHe noted that this problem had been closely studied because it is both important in investigating murders particularly fraught with difficulty.\n\nHe described the imprecision of the science involved. He cited the possibility of very large meals, or very small meals, affecting the time taken to digest food.\n\nHe cautioned that different types of food are digested at different speeds, that different people digest food at different speeds, and that the same person could digest food at different rates from one day to the next.\n\nHe explained that food continued to be digested after death. Only then would he allow that the probable time between meal and death was, probably, approximately, two hours.\n\nNo prosthetics\n\n Vermeulen, on the other hand, presented his theory that Pistorius was not wearing prosthetics when he broke down the toilet door in what Roux would later refer to as an \"ambush\" (the finding was not contained in the written report Vermeulen had compiled).\n\nVermeulen then found himself defending that theory from a furious attack by the defence counsel, at one point being made to balance on his knees but with his feet in the air - trying to swing a cricket bat. Roux pushed hard: What constitutes an \"unnatural\" position in which to swing a cricket bat? How many ­positions were actually tested?\n\nIf the police stood in service of the accused as much as the prosecution, as Vermeulen said, why was a version of events presented by Pistorius not tested under laboratory conditions?\n\nVermeulen, at times with a bemused expression, found his hypothesis gradually eroded through small concessions and new caveats.\n\nTo lay watchers, it appeared that Vermeulen was demolished by the defence, while Saayman held his ground.\n\nBasic principles\n\n To scientists working in the rarefied air of academia, it appeared that Vermeulen had ignored basic principles; Saayman stuck to them.\n\nTo police with a job to do, one officer commented, it seemed that Saayman lacked the guts to point the finger of accusation, whereas Vermeulen did his job.\n\nTo some judicial officers, it seemed Vermeulen provided a testable version of events, even if it were found wanting, but Saayman's approach left the court to interpret his data with too little guidance.\n\nAll of which is, of course, irrelevant, and how Judge Thokozile Masipa interpreted the evidence of each expert will only be clear when she provides a summary of evidence before delivering the verdict.\n\nIf theory holds and the history of complex cases is any guide, the court will not see any individual witness or single piece of evidence as either bolstering or undermining Pistorius's version of events, nor will it point to a smoking gun proving whether or not a murder was committed.\n\nInstead, it will consider all the information before it: as pieces of a puzzle to be weighed and tested against one another - measured for import and plausibility, and carefully fitted into the whole.\n\nCounsel for the state and defence in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius on Thursday said they had agreed to continue his trial for an additional two weeks before planning further dates.\n\nThe new dates had not been ratified by the court at the time of publication, but that was considered a formality.\n\nThe case was due to be heard between March 3 and March 20, but halfway through that period it was evident that far more time would be required - with prosecutors still painstakingly building a case and state witnesses subjected to lengthy cross-examination.\n\nThe trial is now expected to continue without interruption until April 4, with an assessment to be done towards the middle of April on how much further court time will be required and to agree on dates. - Phillip de Wet",

Listen to the full interview here.\n\nKhoury says the biggest spike in content creation around the trial was on day one, with 80,000 pieces of original content being generated worldwide.\n\nMonday saw another spike in interest and by Friday, Khoury was reporting around 1,000 unique inserts about the trial every hour.\n\nHer company's heat map reveals just how much play the story is getting worldwide.\n\nIn recent days, Australia's media coverage of the case has ramped up considerably, with that nation taking position number three worldwide.\n\nAround 42 percent of all news coverage in South Africa is devoted to the trial at the moment.\n\nIn stark contrast, coverage of the Marikana commission of inquiry is only making up 4 percent of total South African news coverage.\n\nKhoury says witnesses are also feeling the glare of the media and social media spotlight, but mentions of their names quickly diminish as they leave the stand.\n\nThe state's first witness Michelle Burger remains the most mentioned witness so far, with Darren Fresco a close second.\n\nDuring his brief stint on the stand, more than 5,000 pieces of content were generated about him.\n\nLegal teams are also making a splash on social media, but one name stands out above the rest is defence advocate Barry Roux.\n\nHe received the most mentions, which saw him become a meme star.\n\nIn terms of journalists, South African investigative reporter Debora Patta is leading the pack in terms of her reach on Twitter.\n\nPatta is covering the trial for international broadcasters.\n\nKhoury's research reveals Patta's tweets are getting six to seven times more referrals than her three closest rivals, one of whom is EWN's Barry Bateman.",

          "fulltext": u"Both Gert Saayman and Johan Vermeulen are applied scientists. Both hold a number of formal qualifications that saw them trained in forensic investigations. Both have plied their respective trades for decades. Both have much experience in acting as expert witnesses in criminal trials, and explaining their sometimes complex findings to courts.\n\nBut in the second week of the trial of Oscar Pistorius for the killing of Reeva Steenkamp, forensic pathologist Saayman and ­materials analyst Vermeulen had very ­different experiences in the witness box, vividly illustrating both the advantages and the pitfalls of matching the scientific method to a system of adversarial justice.\n\nAll indications are that judgment in the Pistorius murder trial - a case that prosecutor Gerrie Nel himself described as circumstantial - will hinge on various branches of forensic science, from ballistics to pathology.\n\nThere is every reason to believe the findings drawn from the science will be highly contested; Pistorius's defence team has lined up experts to counter witnesses called by the state.\n\nDefence lead advocate Barry Roux SC did not wait to call his own witnesses to begin the legal assault on the state's version of events on the night Steenkamp died.\n\nUnusual strategy\n\n Continuing an unusual strategy implemented during bail proceedings a year ago, when Pistorius submitted a highly detailed account of the night, the defence team made no secret of the sequence of events it will present to the court - a sequence it will argue shows Pistorius did not commit murder.\n\nIt was an approach that saw Vermeulen mauled by Roux during cross-examination, pushed to participate in sometimes bizarre ­physical demonstrations of the cricket bat and door he had been tasked with examining, and forced into joining ever more complicated speculation about plausible and implausible sequences of events.\n\nSaayman, by contrast, had an easier time under cross-examination earlier in the week, with most of his findings and many of his conclusions from Steenkamp's autopsy accepted as presented.\n\nThe difference seemed rooted in a difference of approach.\n\nThe meticulous Saayman described a process that differentiated between observation and interpretation, providing a few hypotheses gingerly, with many caveats. He presented work almost entirely free of assumptions - but also of hard, testable findings.\n\nTwo approaches\n\n Whereas Saayman laid out measurements and then spoke in terms of probabilities, Vermeulen provided what he considered likely scenarios, then explained why he had reached the conclusions he had. Saayman's language was peppered with precise medical terms impenetrable to the lay person and requiring less precise explanation; Vermeulen used vaguely defined words and phrases imprecise enough to make an academic cringe.\n\nYet the decidedly more blue-collar approach to finding the truth taken by police employee Vermeulen may be preferable to Saayman's more scientifically pure approach in a court.\n\n\"You want information put to you, but you also want to have a version that silks [senior advocates] can bash around [to] see if it stands up,\" explained a court officer not involved in the matter. \"If a guy is saying, 'this is what I think happened', that is a witness we can evaluate. If a guy says, 'here is what I measured', it can lack meaning.\"\n\nBut had each been defending a thesis outside a court, or been subjected to peer review of a paper, Saayman would have succeeded where Vermeulen would fail.\n\nBoth men presented evidence not in keeping with the version of events Pistorius described on the night of Valentine's Day 2013, before and after he shot Steenkamp. Pistorius said the couple had turned in for the night hours before midnight; Saayman said Steenkamp might have eaten something several hours later. Pistorius said he was wearing his prosthetic legs when he broke down a door to reach Steenkamp; Vermeulen said it appeared that Pistorius was so low to the ground at the time that he must have been standing on his stumps.\n\nWorlds apart\n\n The manner in which they presented their findings was worlds apart. Saayman delivered what was, in effect, a mini-lecture to explain the caveats that went with his finding of when Steenkamp had had her last meal.\n\nHe noted that this problem had been closely studied because it is both important in investigating murders particularly fraught with difficulty.\n\nHe described the imprecision of the science involved. He cited the possibility of very large meals, or very small meals, affecting the time taken to digest food.\n\nHe cautioned that different types of food are digested at different speeds, that different people digest food at different speeds, and that the same person could digest food at different rates from one day to the next.\n\nHe explained that food continued to be digested after death. Only then would he allow that the probable time between meal and death was, probably, approximately, two hours.\n\nNo prosthetics\n\n Vermeulen, on the other hand, presented his theory that Pistorius was not wearing prosthetics when he broke down the toilet door in what Roux would later refer to as an \"ambush\" (the finding was not contained in the written report Vermeulen had compiled).\n\nVermeulen then found himself defending that theory from a furious attack by the defence counsel, at one point being made to balance on his knees but with his feet in the air - trying to swing a cricket bat. Roux pushed hard: What constitutes an \"unnatural\" position in which to swing a cricket bat? How many ­positions were actually tested?\n\nIf the police stood in service of the accused as much as the prosecution, as Vermeulen said, why was a version of events presented by Pistorius not tested under laboratory conditions?\n\nVermeulen, at times with a bemused expression, found his hypothesis gradually eroded through small concessions and new caveats.\n\nTo lay watchers, it appeared that Vermeulen was demolished by the defence, while Saayman held his ground.\n\nBasic principles\n\n To scientists working in the rarefied air of academia, it appeared that Vermeulen had ignored basic principles; Saayman stuck to them.\n\nTo police with a job to do, one officer commented, it seemed that Saayman lacked the guts to point the finger of accusation, whereas Vermeulen did his job.\n\nTo some judicial officers, it seemed Vermeulen provided a testable version of events, even if it were found wanting, but Saayman's approach left the court to interpret his data with too little guidance.\n\nAll of which is, of course, irrelevant, and how Judge Thokozile Masipa interpreted the evidence of each expert will only be clear when she provides a summary of evidence before delivering the verdict.\n\nIf theory holds and the history of complex cases is any guide, the court will not see any individual witness or single piece of evidence as either bolstering or undermining Pistorius's version of events, nor will it point to a smoking gun proving whether or not a murder was committed.\n\nInstead, it will consider all the information before it: as pieces of a puzzle to be weighed and tested against one another - measured for import and plausibility, and carefully fitted into the whole.\n\nCounsel for the state and defence in the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius on Thursday said they had agreed to continue his trial for an additional two weeks before planning further dates.\n\nThe new dates had not been ratified by the court at the time of publication, but that was considered a formality.\n\nThe case was due to be heard between March 3 and March 20, but halfway through that period it was evident that far more time would be required - with prosecutors still painstakingly building a case and state witnesses subjected to lengthy cross-examination.\n\nThe trial is now expected to continue without interruption until April 4, with an assessment to be done towards the middle of April on how much further court time will be required and to agree on dates. - Phillip de Wet",
