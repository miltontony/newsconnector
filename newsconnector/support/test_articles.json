    "fulltext": "Canberra - The Stormers' 15-25 Vodacom Super Rugby loss to the Brumbies in Canberra was a bitter pill to swallow for head coach Allister Coetzee on Saturday.\n\n\n\nThe men from Cape Town conceded a last-minute penalty try to the Brumbies to miss out on a losing bonus point as they suffered a third tour defeat in the process.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the www.iamastormer.com website from his team's base in Canberra afterwards, Coetzee said: \"This is definitely a bitter pill to swallow for us, even more disappointing than the losses to the Crusaders and the Chiefs.\n\n\n\n\"It's frustrating as we're our own worst enemies at the moment. Individual errors and poor decision-making at key moments continue to cost us,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\"But we're not about to give up. I've said it before, no Stormers team will ever give up and we will be putting everything into securing a win in our final tour game next week (against the Reds).\"\n\n\n\nThe Stormers lost by one point to the Crusaders two weeks ago, conceding a late penalty goal to go down 14-13, and last weekend they were trailing the Chiefs by four points (24-20) before conceding two late tries to miss out on a losing bonus point (as they lost 36-20).\n\n\n\n\"It's the third week in a row that we've not stuck to the plan in closing a game out,\" said Coetzee. \"It's a lack of composure in pressure situations, but hopefully we've finally learnt our lesson.\"\n\n\n\nThe team also suffered a blow shortly before today's clash against the Brumbies when veteran flanker Schalk Burger was forced to withdraw with a torn quad muscle.\n\n\n\nTo make matters worse, Burger - boasting 91 Super Rugby caps - will head back to South Africa on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\"It's always a big loss losing a player at the 11th hour - especially someone of Schalk's calibre,\" said Coetzee. \"But we're fortunate to be able to call upon someone like Siya Kolisi, who is of course a Springbok himself, and then there's also a quality player like Nizaam Carr in the mix too.\n\n\n\n\"Schalk will head home,\" added Coetzee, \"and we will call up a lock replacement as Jurie van Vuuren, who made his Super Rugby today, is (first and foremost) a flanker and can provide additional loose forward cover in Schalk's absence.\"\n\n\n\nAn announcement on Burger's replacement will be made on Monday, either by flying in a lock from within the union or outside the Stormers region, whilst Coetzee also confirmed that Kolisi (who took a slight knock to his head) and fullback Gio Aplon (knee) would be fit for next week's clash against the Reds.\n\n\n\nA call on the fitness of Jaco Taute - who missed today's match with a shoulder injury (AC Joint) - will be made next week.\n\n\n\n\"The other positive was the return to action of Juan de Jongh,\" Coetzee told the official Stormers website.\n\n\n\n\"Juan looked very sharp when he came on, despite limited game time for him this year, and it adds crucial depth to our backline with one week left on tour.\"\n\n\n\n",

    "fulltext": "Chittagong - Sri Lanka produced a superb death bowling performance to beat the Blue Label Telecoms Proteas by five runs in the opening match in Pool A at the ICC World Twenty20 in Chittagong on Saturday.\n\nThere were two key moments – the first when Albie Morkel, having hit successive sixes, failed to put away a low full toss from Ajantha Mendis to be caught on the boundary in the 17th over. At that stage the Proteas needed 33 runs with six wickets in hand.\n\nThe Proteas went into the last three overs needing 29 runs and they stayed on target when David Miller and Farhaan Behardien took 10 runs off Lasith Malinga to reduce the target to a manageable 19 in two overs.\n\nNuwan Kulasekara then produced the second key moment when he conceded only four runs in the 19th over and took the wicket of Behardien.\n\nIt left the experienced Malinga to defend 15 in the last over with Miller having to retain the strike for the Proteas to have a chance of winning. Both Dale Steyn and Miller were run out as the Sri Lankans held their nerve as the target proved to be beyond the tail.\n\nSri Lankan opening batsman, Kusal Perera, was named man of the match for his quick-fire innings of 61 off 40 balls (6 fours and 3 sixes) that enabled his side to reach 51/2 in the six power play overs. This was slightly better than the Proteas’ 40/1.\n\nIn the end the Proteas did well to fight back from Sri Lanka’s start to restrict them to 165/7 thanks largely to Imran Tahir, who continued his love affair with the sub-continent to take 3/26 in his four overs.\n\nSteyn recovered from his hamstring injury to take his place but Faf du Plessis did not with AB de Villiers taking over the captaincy.",

    "fulltext": "Tokyo - The Springbok Sevens coach Neil Powell believes his team will need to do a lot better if they are to defend their Tokyo Sevens title this year, even though they ended day one unbeaten in Japan.\n\nPowell wasn’t happy with the way his team performed, on a day where they needed to dig deep to beat Kenya and Argentina, and only really took control of the game against Japan from the beginning.\n\nOn day two the Blitzbokke will face tournament surprise package USA (kick off 4.34am, GMT+2, CAT) in their quarterfinal, and will need to have a better control of matters than they did on day one.\n\nPowell wasn’t mincing his words when he said he wasn’t happy.\n\n“I didn’t think we played well today, we gave away far too many penalties and our discipline was bad,” the Blitzbok coach explained and with good reason.\n\nA yellow card in both the Kenya and Argentina game meant the Blitzbokke needed to come back from behind twice, and for at least half of both games the South Africans looked out of sorts.\n\nBoth in the Kenya and Argentina game they only managed to pull away midway in the second half, a far cry from their normal consistency under Powell.\n\nIn the Argentina game Powell did let a number of the reserves get a decent run, and it paid off, with Kwagga Smith scoring a brace and Steven Hunt adding his name to the scoresheet as they surged near the end for a quite comfortable victory.\n\nYet saying that, Powell does know that day two is the money day, and the day it counts the most.\n\nThe USA, who are under South African born coach Matt Hawkins, need a good result to ensure they stay as one of the eight core teams in the HSBC Sevens Series and will be up for the match.\n\nWhile they did lose to France in their final game, they opened the day with a win over Samoa, shocking the South Sea Islanders and then followed it up by holding Fiji to a 19-all draw, showing they can compete with the best.\n\nAdd to that Canada getting a quarterfinal place again, as a non-core team, and the pressure certainly is on the Americans on day two.\n\nIn other results, New Zealand, Fiji and England all topped their groups to head to the quarters, with Samoa, Wales and Scotland not making the top eight this time around.\n\nNew Zealand will face Australia, Paul Treu’s Kenyan side have a date with Fiji while England face Canada in their quarterfinal.\n\nSemifinals are set for 7.08am and 7.30am respectively.\n\nThe final will take place at 9.43am. \n\n",

They initially struggled to get going against the tenacious tournament hosts, Japan, but a better second half secured them a comprehensive 33-5 victory.\n\nIn their final match of the day, the South Africans were left frustrated by unforced errors and some solid tackling by the physical Argentine outfit, especially during the first half.\n\nTheir cause was not helped when wing Jamba Ulengo was yellow-carded after he was spotted throwing the ball away, which prevented the opposition from launching a quick counter-attack.\n\nDuring the halftime break, Powell urged his team to keep their shape and to improve their discipline and their improved performance netted them three well-worked tries in the second half and also a comfortable victory.\n\nMartin Rodrigues opened the scoring for Argentina after a patient build-up, while Stephan Dippenaar scored just before the break for the Blitzboks. Kwagga Smith (2) and Steven Hunt added three more tries after the break.\n\n“I am glad we qualified for the quarterfinals but not too pleased with our performances.

Meanwhile, diarrheal diseases kill 700,000 children every year, most of which could have been prevented with better sanitation.\n\n\"In the West, such things are a nuisance, but people don't lose their lives,\" said Christopher Elias, president of global development at the Gates Foundation.\n\n\"People don't immediately realize the damage done by infections coming from human waste.\"\n\nIndia has been encouraging rural communities to build toilets, and last year launched a $1.6 billion program to help.\n\nBut building sanitation systems in developing countries is not easy.\n\nFlush toilets are not always an option.\n\nOthers lack links to sewage pipes or treatment plants.\n\nTo be successful, scientists said, the designs being exhibited at Saturday's Toilet Fair had to go beyond treating urine and feces as undesirable waste, and recognize them as profit-generating resources for electricity, fertilizer or fuel.\n\n\"Traditionally, people have gone into communities and said, 'Let's dig you a pit.' That's seen as condescension, a token that isn't very helpful. After all, who is going to clean that pit?\" said M. Sohail, professor of sustainable infrastructure at Loughborough University in the U.K.\n\nAll the designs are funded by Gates Foundation grants and in various stages of development.\n\nSome toilets collapsed neatly for easy portability into music festivals, disaster zones or illegal slums.\n\nOne emptied into pits populated by waste-munching cockroaches and worms.\n\nOne Washington-based company, Janicki Industries, designed a power plant that could feed off the waste from a small city to produce 150 megawatts of electricity, enough to power thousands of homes.\n\nThe University of the West of England, Bristol, showcased a urine-powered fuel cell to charge cellphones overnight.\n\nAnother team from the University of Colorado, Boulder, brought a system concentrating solar power through fiber optic cables to heat waste to about 300 degrees Celsius.\n\nAside from killing pathogens, the process creates a charcoal-like product called biochar useful as cooking fuel or fertilizer.\n\n\"At the core are really interesting scientific principles, so translating this into scientific advances that people can relate to is really exciting,\" said one of the project leaders, Karl Linden, professor of environmental engineering in Boulder.\n\n\"Biochar is an important subject for scientists at the moment, since it can be used to sequester carbon in the soil for 1,000 years or more.\"\n\nA team from Beijing Sunnybreeze Technologies Inc. also brought a solar-biochar system, but with the solar panels heating air that will dry sludgy human waste into nuggets that are then heated further under low-oxygen conditions to create biochar.\n\n\"We are trying to build a system simple enough to be fixed in the village,\" technical adviser John Keating said.\n\nOne company from the southern Indian state of Kerala was not as concerned with providing toilets as with cleaning them.\n\nToilets are more common in Kerala than they are in much of the country, but no one wants to clean them, said Bincy Baby of Eram Scientific Solutions.\n\n\"There is a stigma. The lowest of the low are the ones who clean the toilets,\" Baby said.\n\nEram's solution is a coin-operated eToilet with an electronic system that triggers an automated, self-cleaning mechanism.\n\nWith 450 prototypes now looped into sewage systems across India, electrical engineers are lining up for jobs as toilet technicians.\n\n\"Now, they're proud of their jobs.\"",

They then beat Newcastle in the FA Cup Final to record their first double since 1971.\n\n1998-99\n\nArsenal would be second best to Manchester United in this season, losing the title by a single point, and losing the FA Cup semi-final in extra-time to Sir Alex Fergusons side courtesy of Ryan Giggs famous goal.\n\n1999-2000\n\nAnelka was sold to Real Madrid, but the arrival of Thierry Henry from Juventus began a new era at the club. There were also major changes at the back, with Steve Bould retiring and Nigel Winterburn dropping down the pecking order - the end of the old guard. Their replacements were only good for the runners-up spot again.\n\n2000-01\n\nRobert Pires and Sylvain Wiltord were among the summer arrivals, but Overmars and Petit left for Barcelona and without them Arsenal had to settle for second again, also losing the FA Cup Final to Liverpool.\n\n2001-02\n\nSol Campbell arrived on a free transfer from rivals Tottenham, and Wenger unearthed the little known Kolo Toure as Arsenal reclaimed the title and did the double again, memorably beating United at Old Trafford to win the league before seeing off Chelsea in the FA Cup Final.\n\n2002-03\n\nWith Tony Adams retired to be replaced by Pascal Cygan, Vieira was elevated to captain and Gilberto Silva arrived to strengthen the midfield. However, Arsenal could not defend their league crown as they finished second, consoling themselves with an FA Cup Final victory over Southampton.\n\n2003-04\n\nThe Invincibles season will forever stand out on Wengers resume. Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was the only significant arrival in a quiet summer (discounting a little known youngster called Cesc Fabregas, initially bound for the academy) as Arsenals funds were taken up by the new stadium. But it worked a treat as Arsenal became the first team since Preston North End more than a century before to complete a campaign unbeaten. Wenger had splashed the cash in the winter, signing Jose Antonio Reyes, and at the end of the season he agreed a deal to sign Robin van Persie for 3m.\n\n2004-05\n\nArsenals unbeaten run ended at 49 in the infamous Battle of the Buffet at Old Trafford, and it signalled another momentum swing as United regained the title. However, they did beat Fergusons side on penalties in the FA Cup Final - still the last major trophy Wenger has won with the club.\n\n2005-06\n\nVieiras departure to Juventus preceded a rapid fall in Arsenals league fortunes as they only managed fourth place, their worst finish under Wenger. However, there seemed no reason to panic as they reached the final of the Champions League, where they were edged out 2-1 by Barcelona after the controversial dismissal of Lehmann.\n\n2006-07\n\nA major end-of-season clearout saw the likes of Pires, Cygan, Campbell, Reyes, and Ashley Cole transferred out while Dennis Bergkamp retired, and without them Arsenal - celebrating a first season in their new home - again laboured to fourth, with little comfort to fall back on in the cup competitions.\n\n2007-08\n\nThe clear-out continued a summer later with Henry leaving for Barcelona, while Freddie Ljungberg and Reyes also departed. Arsenal topped the table for much of the season regardless, but faded to finish third, while losing to rivals Tottenham in the League Cup semi-finals.\n\n2008-09\n\nWenger signed Samir Nasri and Mickael Silvestre in a bid to get back in the title frame, but they could do no better than fourth, while losing in both the FA Cup and Champions League semi-finals.\n\n2009-10\n\nAlthough Fabregas had now emerged as a truly outstanding player, scoring 19 goals from midfield, Arsenal were still off the pace in the league, finishing third, while they lost to Barcelona in the quarter-finals of the Champions League.\n\n2010-11\n\nWenger spent big on Laurent Koscielny and Sebastian Squillaci to try and fix Arsenals defence, but it was a now familiar story in the league as they came in fourth. They had faded badly at the end of the season, something many attributed to their stunning League Cup final loss to Birmingham City, who scored an 89th-minute winner.\n\n2011-12\n\nBig money deals for Gervinho, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mikel Arteta did little to placate fans after the departure of Fabregas, and their fears were borne out by a stunning 8-2 defeat to Manchester United. The season ended with another third-place finish and cup campaigns that fizzled out early.\n\n2012-13\n\nAnother tough summer saw Van Persie join United and Alex Song move to Barcelona. Wengers new-look side found themselves in a tough battle with rivals Tottenham for the final Champions League place. Fourth spot - secured only on the final day of the season - was deemed a success, but unrest grew over the following summer until the club-record 42.5million signing of Mesut Ozil signalled new ambitions heading into 2014.",

The computer system, in comparison, had an 85 percent accuracy.\n\n\"In highly social species such as humans,\" said senior author Kang Lee, professor at the Dr. Eric Jackman Institute of Child Study at the University of Toronto, \"faces have evolved to convey rich information, including expressions of emotion and pain. And, because of the way our brains are built, people can simulate emotions they're not actually experiencing -- so successfully that they fool other people. The computer is much better at spotting the subtle differences between involuntary and voluntary facial movements.\"\n\nThe study found the biggest indicator of fake expressions is the mouth, particularly how it opens, and when.\n\nIf feigning pain, the mouth opens too regularly, and with \"less variation.\"\n\nThe researchers plant to investigate whether \"over-regularity\" is a signature of fake demonstrations.\n\n\"By revealing the dynamics of facial action through machine vision systems,\" said Bartlett, \"our approach has the potential to elucidate 'behavioral fingerprints' of the neural-control systems involved in emotional signaling.\"\n\nBartlett also noted the computer vision system could have other real-world applications, such as those relating to law, homeland security, psychopathology, job screening and medicine.\n\n\"As with causes of pain, these scenarios also generate strong emotions, along with attempts to minimize, mask, and fake such emotions, which may involve 'dual control' of the face,\" she said.\n\n\"In addition, our computer-vision system can be applied to detect states in which the human face may provide important clues as to health, physiology, emotion, or thought, such as drivers' expressions of sleepiness, students' expressions of attention and comprehension of lectures, or responses to treatment of affective disorders.\"\n\nCar makers like Volvo and PSA Peugeot Citroen have recently revealed they are currently working on facial detection systems that recognize driver distraction and fatigue or emotional states that could have an impact on their control of the vehicle.",

We gave away far too many penalties and our discipline was bad, the Blitzbok coach explained.\n\nA yellow card in both the Kenya and Argentina games meant the Blitzbokke needed to come back from behind twice, and for at least half of both games the South Africans looked out of sorts.\n\nIn both those games, they only managed to pull away midway through the second half a far cry from their normal consistency under Powell.\n\nIn the Argentina game Powell let a number of the reserves get a decent run, and it paid off, with Kwagga Smith scoring a brace and Steven Hunt adding his name to the scoresheet as they surged near the end for a fairly comfortable victory.\n\nPowell knows, of course, that day two is the money day though, and the day that counts the most.\n\nThe USA, who are under South African-born coach Matt Hawkins, need a good result to ensure they remain one of the eight core teams in the HSBC Sevens World Series, and will be highly motivated for the match.\n\nWhile they lost to France in their final game, the Americans opened the day with a win over Samoa, shocking the South Sea Islanders, and then followed it up by holding Fiji to a 19-all draw, showing they can compete with the best.\n\nMeanwhile, Canada, a non-core team, have once again claimed a quarterfinal place, so adding to the pressure on the Americans on day two.\n\nIn other results, New Zealand, Fiji and England all topped their groups to head to the quarters, with Samoa, Wales and Scotland not making the top eight this time around.\n\nNew Zealand will face Australia, while Paul Treus Kenyan side have a date with Fiji and England face Canada in their quarterfinal.\n\nSemifinals are set for 7.08am and 7.30am respectively.\n\nThe final will take place at 9.43am. \n\n",

    "fulltext": "Coaches could hardly watch the tape, it turned their stomachs. The seeds for Stephen F. Austins improbable run to the third-round of the NCAA tournament were planted in a hotel room near Johnson City, Tenn., on Nov. 23.\n\nAfter the Lumberjacks lost to East Tennessee State, 66-58, first-year coach Brad Underwood and assistants were so steamed that they forced themselves to watch immediately watch tape of the horrid defensive effort that night at the hotel. How was that experience?\n\nWe about threw up all over each other, assistant Mike Boynton Jr. told USA TODAY Sports a few weeks ago.\n\nStephen F. Austin has not lost since.\n\nThe 12th-seeded Lumberjacks converted a four-point play to push Fridays second-round NCAA tournament game against fifth-seeded VCU into overtime, and Stephen F. Austin ultimately won, 77-75.\n\nThey are among the most compelling stories of this NCAA tournament not only because they are a double-digit seed playing into the tournaments third round. They also are a colorful, free-spirited group of players think Florida Gulf Coast from last season who have captivated the locals in Nacogdoches, Texas, which is about a three-hour drive southeast of Dallas.\n\nThink basketball matters there? A police officer gave a USA TODAY Sports reporter a police escort through traffic to the coaches offices during a recent visit.\n\nThis is a special place, Underwood said. It can be a sleeping giant.\n\nUnderwood knew the potential of this team after it suffered a 10-point defeat at Texas on Nov. 15. What the Lumberjacks lack in size, they make up for in defensive tenacity. Theyve ranked second nationally in turnover percentage, but they dont disrupt offenses with a full-court press. Instead, they play suffocating half-court defense, trying to stick to the men they cover like a second skin.\n\nPlayers such as Desmond Haymon, the best leader Underwood has ever been around, and Jacob Parker, probably the teams best overall player, highlight a group that can appear almost emotionless on the court at times. But in the locker room they are as loose as possible.\n\nThey have three rap songs. And they conduct a nonsensical shooting routine every road game that players love. The origin?\n\nLast year in the NIT, then-senior guard Hal Bateman couldnt shoot a lick but was making a lot of threes during shoot around. After he made each three, he would say the same thing, Shooter gym, cuh!\n\nSo Parker and Thomas Walkup have done the same routine every road game and they videotape it. Theyll bounce the ball between their legs, shoot a three and theyll say, Shooter gym, cuh! Then some coaches will even say, Shooter gym, cuh?”\n\nThey plan to release video of these clips soon. The phrase Shooter gym, cuh has special, deep, profound meaning for all the players and coaches. Really, it does. What exactly does it mean?\n\nWho knows? said Parker.\n\nThat kind of sums up what is a colorful group full of personality and confidence. As Haymon said a few weeks ago, The teams, they had better be aware that we are coming.\n\nThe teams, as well as college basketball fans nationwide, are now clearly aware that the Lumberjacks are coming.",

    "fulltext": "There were no tantrums. No endless summer saga of speculation and certainly no sign of a transfer request. Just a telegram which read: No, thank you.\n\nThat was the simple, succinct message delivered by Ron Greenwood to Sir Matt Busby after Manchester United tabled a spectacular 200,000 bid for West Hams World Cup-winning No 9 in 1967.\n\nA courteous rejection to Old Trafford returned with Sir Geoff Hurst staying put at Upton Park.\n\nFive hundred games in the claret and blue, 242 goals. How things could have been different?\n\n'At that time, it was the biggest fee around,' England legend Sir Geoff said, speaking exclusively to .\n\n'It was in the 1967-68 season. Ron Greenwood simply sent a telegram back [to Busby] saying, \"No thanks\". And that was the end of the story!'\n\nHad Hurst departed his native east London for the North-West, he would have joined the likes of Sir Bobby Charlton, Denis Law, Nobby Stiles and George Best on their unforgettable journey towards the European Cup. \n\n\n\nInstead he stuck around with fellow greats such as Bobby Moore and Martin Peters. And for the man who inspired West Ham to FA Cup glory in 1964 and to European Cup Winners Cup success a year later, it is a decision that he has never debated.\n\n'I have to tell you it has never been an issue for me,' he said. 'Manchester United are a fantastic club but I achieved all of my ambitious at West Ham. They are the club that gave me my chance from grassroots football.'\n\nThat upbringing remains Hursts passion even to this day. Now 72, the only man to have scored a hat-trick in a World Cup final prides himself in his role as McDonalds Director of Football. \n\n\n\nHe acts as an ambassador for them, helping to celebrate the thousands of volunteers who dedicate their time at that level of the game throughout the year.\n\nThere is a certain irony that Hammers hero Hurst would go on to work for a food giant. After all, it was at Cassettaris Cafe on Barking Road where his role in the iconic side of the 1960s was discussed daily with his peers, using salt and pepper pots to illustrate tactics.\n\nTimes have changed now. And such a proposition for the clubs outstanding goalscorer might be taken differently today.\n\n'I think in todays era, if a player at West Ham was asked to go to Man United, then the player generally would move,' Hurst added.\n\n'But my first opportunity was at West Ham. Im a very loyal type of person so it never disturbed me that I wasnt able to go.\n\n'The clubs had the power those days as opposed to what is dramatically the other way round today. It was not the case in our time and from a personal point of view it never disappointed me.\n\n'Had I have left for United, I think I could have played in the European Cup final at Wembley in 1968. \n\n\n\n'Yet not for one second have I ever been disappointed for not making that move because I achieved all my ambitious for the club I love dearly and still support.'\n\nThe 1966 Three Lions legend now lives in Cheltenham and rarely returns to the Boleyn Ground due to the long commute.\n\nBut he did drop in on the team last week when they trained at St Georges Park ahead of the 3-1 defeat by Stoke and remains as fervent about West Ham as he was when he played for them between 1959 and 1972.\n\n'Of course, I still support West Ham,' said Hurst before going on to salute Sam Allardyce, who collected the manager of the month award for February following the clubs Premier League revival. \n\n\n\n'Going back two or three months there was a lot of negativity. They were at the bottom of the league, people were questioning whether Sam Allardyce is good enough and so on. But hes turned it around because hes a good, experienced manager.\n\n'I wont hang on to people who say, \"Sams got to go because he doesnt play the West Ham way\", because youve got to play the way that suits the squad youve got and try to get the best out of them.\n\n'If we finish 10th and Andy Carroll scores a goal every game until the end of the season, well that by any standards from where the club has come from is a fantastic achievement. Full stop.'\n\nSo does Hurst believe West Ham will get back to winning ways and beat champions Manchester United this evening?\n\n'I'm always very positive and very hopeful,' he said. 'I refuse to be negative on the basis that Im not a negative person. I was successful as a player because I was positive and as a fan of West Ham I always think theyre going to do well.'\n\nGiven the circumstances, some are inclined to share Hursts optimism with many Hammers fans believing an out-of-sorts United side are there for the taking.\n\nDespite a much-needed midweek Champions League win, pressure is mounting on manager David Moyes as Uniteds disastrous Barclays Premier League defence threatens to see them miss out on the top four.\n\nBut much like Hurst has backed Allardyce, he believes the Scot is still the right man to lead them. \n\n\n\n'No club has the right to be at the top forever,' said Hurst.  'But they should not panic. If you go back to Liverpool who dominated for a long time in the game they are just making their way back now after a long transitional period. \n\n\n\n'I still think David Moyes is the right man for the club. If you go back to Sir Alex Ferguson, he was given four years. Okay times are different, but it was almost four years before he cracked it.\n\n'Gradually, Moyes will get the side that he he wants and the players he is after. \n\n\n\n'It will be a bit more difficult if they do not finish in the top four. The top players may be reluctant to go there if they are not in the Champions League.\n\n'But I still think he is the right manager for Manchester United. Fergie recommended him.  Its a season of transition but I think Moyes will turn it around and theyll be OK.' \n\n\n\n Read the full interview with Sir Geoff Hurst in the official West Ham United matchday programme. \n\n One lucky fan who buys issue number 1,966 will win a 2013/14 away shirt signed by Martin Peters MBE.

    "fulltext": "A bipartisan group of lawmakers is urging the Senate Finance Committee to renew clean energy tax incentives that expired at the end of 2013, renewing a familiar fight over a 22-year-old subsidy that critics say is too costly and distorts the market.\n\nThe 144 House and Senate members say the tax credit has created thousands of jobs and expanded the role wind energy is playing in producing renewable energy.\n\n\"Like all businesses, the wind industry seeks certainty and predictability so that long term project decisions and investments can be made. Without that stability, we once again risk losing many of the jobs, infrastructure and investment that the wind industry has created,\" read the letter by Sens. Mark Udall, D-Colo., Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and 24 other senators.\n\nA coalition of 118 House members led by Reps. Steve King, R-Iowa, and Dave Loebsack, D-Iowa, sent a similar letter to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.\n\nThe tax credit, established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992, was originally worth 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity produced. Last year, the rate was worth 2.3 cents per kilowatt hour and a one-year extension would cost $6 billion, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\nLast November, more than 50 lawmakers urged House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp to let the wind energy credit expire at the end of the year, arguing the subsidy \"is now more valuable than the price of the electricity the plants actually generate.\"\n\nAccording to The Hill, the Senate Finance Committee is expected to consider extending more than 50 tax incentives, including renewable energy credits, next month.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., a prominent opponent of the subsidy, criticized the tax credit in an statement to Roll Call as \"a colossal, unjustified waste of taxpayer dollars at a time when the nation has an unsustainable debt.\"\n\n\"The subsidy is so large that it allows wind developers in some markets to literally give away their electricity, Alexander told the publication. \"This in turn is forcing utilities to shut down nuclear plants and coal plants. After 20 years, there is no excuse for continuing to extend this subsidy of a mature technology, which was intended to jumpstart an industry.\"\n\nThe Institute for Energy Research, a group aligned with the oil and gas industry, released a study last year disputed by wind energy producers that found that states which aren't wind industry hubs and don't receive much from the tax credit pool \"unfairly shoulder the burden.\"\n\nThe American Wind Energy Association on Friday praised the lawmakers pushing for an extension and noted that 70 percent of congressional districts have either utility-scale wind farms or factories.\n\n\"We look forward to Congress, in particular the Senate Finance Committee, acting quickly to extend the PTC and ITC so that the U.S. remains a global leader and our businesses can continue building, expanding and hiring,\" Tom Kiernan, CEO of the association, said in a statement.",

I do not want to look somewhere else. I want to stay here. There shouldn't be any uncertainty at all.

Then, at half-time I asked my physio Gary Lewin: 'Nobody is talking, what's wrong with them?' and he replied: 'They are hungry'.\n\n\"I hadn't given them their chocolate before the game.
